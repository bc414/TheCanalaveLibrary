# Workplan — Ordered Work-Units (atoms-first)

Produced by Phase D (`forward_plan.md`). This is the build sequence for Phase E. Each work-unit names
its **cell(s)** (Feature # + layer, per `status.md`), its **tool** (per CLAUDE.md Per-Stage Guidance),
its **audit pointer** (`.claude/audit/<Folder>.md`, section), and its **deps** (work-units that must be
at Stage 5 first). CLAUDE.md is the source of truth for stage semantics and file paths — this file
references it, does not restate it.

---

## Read this first (ordering preamble)

**Scope of the numbered sequence = Layers 1–4 (the MVP).** `grid_axes.md` §"The Two Boundaries" is
authoritative: Layers 1–4 are the InteractiveServer MVP (data → service → logic → structure → style);
Layers 5–8 are *additive and batchable* — they swap method bodies / add DDL / add standalone workers
behind contracts frozen in 1–4, and never force a 1–4 change. The resolved "Aspire orchestration during
MVP dev" decision (`forward_plan.md`) confirms this: MVP is InteractiveServer-only, no Redis/WASM,
Layers 5–8 post-MVP. So **every numbered work-unit below builds L2/L3-Logic/L3.5-Structure/L4-Style**
(L1 is done — see WU0). **L5–L8 are gathered into the "Post-MVP" section** at the end, unsequenced and
batched by pattern, not dropped. If this scoping is wrong, stop here — it reshapes everything below.

**Topological, bottom-up, three-phase (spec §9.2).** A cell's dependencies appear *earlier in this file*,
so they're at Stage 5 when reached. Phases:
- **Phase 1 — Atoms.** Leaves + foundational services consumed by many, depending on nothing
  feature-specific. Building these *mints contracts*: once a leaf's parameter/event contract is locked,
  its consumers flip from Stage 2 to Stage 3.
- **Phase 2 — Integration points.** Composites that consume atoms and produce surfaces pages embed
  (`StoryCard`/`StoryDeck`, `UserStoryInteractionPanel`, `ChapterNavigation`, `CommentSection`, …).
- **Phase 3 — Consumers / pages.** Dispatchers and feature pages aggregating Phase-2 output. Internal
  order is loose; deps still hold.

**Stage-4 cells use the resolved direction (audit-summary §0/§3).** Almost all are *stale-code traps*:
build to spec, treat existing code as discard-not-reuse. The flag means "don't copy this code," not "open
question." The two *genuine mechanical* reconciliations (Identity post-move refs; Story L5 endpoint wiring)
are called out where they sit (Identity = WU1; Story L5 = Post-MVP).

**Stage-3 is minted here, not found.** Expect ~0 Stage-3 cells now. opusplan passes on atoms create them;
mark the consumer flip (2→3) when an atom's contract lands, and switch that consumer's tool to Sonnet.

**Tool per work-unit.** opusplan for Stage-2 builds and atom-contract minting; **Opus (reconcile)** for the
residual genuine Stage-4 (WU1); **Sonnet in Claude Code** for cells already Stage-3 (none yet — they appear
as atoms land). L4-Style is never sequenced alone — it rides inside the same work-unit as that feature's
L3/L3.5 build (per Phase D rule; tokens are locked, `layer4-style.md` is the validated spec). "Build +
verify" for any unit touching L4 means render-and-look, not just `dotnet build` — see `forward_plan.md`
Phase E.

**Per-unit loop (Phase E).** pick next → read its audit pointer → feed audit "settled" notes to the tool as
"do not revisit" → build → `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` (should be green; add asserted tests for any new
testable surface per `canalave-conventions/testing.md`'s tier rules) + run the slice (+ visual check if L4)
→ update `status.md` (cell → 5) and this file (unit ✓). Record the covering test tier (Unit / Integration /
RazorComponents) — or why none applies — in the audit Stage note. Conventions skill auto-loads as guardrail.

---

## WU0 — Foundation (Phase A) — DONE ✓

- **Cells:** all L1 (re-modeled per audit-summary §3b) + `InitialSchema` migration + green build.
- **State:** code/schema-complete — `InitialSchema` generated, `dotnet build` green, template debris
  cleared, Identity namespaces partially normalized, three first-run runtime bugs fixed: Stories L2
  DI-registration (detail: `audit/Stories.md` row 4/5), render-mode/interactive-routing (detail:
  `cross-cutting.md` "Render Mode"), `ReadOnlyApplicationDbContext` ctor mismatch. Also pivoted dev
  workflow off Aspire for MVP (detail: `forward_plan.md` "Aspire orchestration during MVP dev").
- **VERIFIED (2026-06-20):** migration applied to a live local Postgres (`ConnectionStrings:canalavedb`,
  direct `TheCanalaveLibrary.Server` run — not AppHost), `DataSeeder` runs, app boots, Identity pages
  load end-to-end (`/`, `/Account/Login`, `/Account/Register` all `200`, no exceptions). The real
  "L1 → Stage 5" gate is closed. Start/stop procedure documented in `.claude/skills/run-server/SKILL.md`.
- **Tool:** Opus/Sonnet, Claude Code. **Pointer:** `forward_plan.md` Phase A addendum + `status.md`.

## Phase 1 — Atoms (mint the contracts)

### WU1 — Identity reconciliation *(genuine Stage-4, mechanical)* — DONE ✓ (2026-06-20)
- **Cells:** 1 L2/L3/L3.5, 52 L2/L3/L3.5 — all now Stage 5.
- **Done:** namespace/asset-path reconciliation (already complete pre-session); completed
  `UserDeletionService`'s four `Restrict`-edge handlers + DI registration + fixed a
  retrying-execution-strategy/manual-transaction bug found while verifying it; rewired
  `DeletePersonalData.razor` to use it; added minimal §3.19 login/logout triggers
  (`LoginDisplay.razor`) to `DesktopLayout`/`MobileLayout`/Identity `MainLayout`; added
  `DevDiagnosticsEndpoints.cs` as the standing home for Development-only verification endpoints.
  Full nav/bell/avatar deferred to WU22/WU30/WU33.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green; live app boot + `/`, `/Account/Login`, `/Account/Register` 200;
  login link renders anonymously; account deletion exercised twice end-to-end against fixture users.
  Detail in `audit/Identity.md` Features 1, 52 Stage-5 notes.
- **Tool:** Opus (reconcile). **Pointer:** `audit/Identity.md` Features 1, 52 (+ audit-summary §3a).
- **Deps:** WU0 runtime gate.

### WU2 — Sprites L2 service *(Stage-4, code works — light rename + cluster move)* — DONE ✓ (2026-06-20)
- **Cells:** 3 L2 — now Stage 5.
- **Done:** renamed `ISpriteService`→`ISpriteReadService`, impl→`ServerSpriteReadService` (now
  primary-constructor DI); moved all three files (interface, server impl, client impl) out of the legacy
  `ServiceInterfaces/`/`Services/` folders into their `Sprites/` cluster folder (Core/Server/Client — see
  `canalave-conventions/SKILL.md` "Code Organization"); updated both `Program.cs` DI registrations.
  **`GetInteractionIcon()` was dropped from scope** (settled WU2 — see `audit/Sprites.md` Feature 3 L2
  and `audit/UserStoryInteractions.md` Feature 16: theme-swappable interaction icons are a
  UserStoryInteraction-domain concept). At WU2 time the intent was to resolve them via the generic
  `GetSpriteUrl` instead; **WU7 superseded that** — interaction icons are inline SVG
  (`IconPath`/`AccentColor`), not a sprite URL at all, so `UserStoryInteractionButton` has no
  relationship to this service, direct or indirect. Contract feeds TagChip and StoryCard. Also
  hardened `canalave-conventions/SKILL.md` "Code Organization" (vertical clusters
  are now a stated rule, legacy folders named, Endpoints colocation settled) and `layer2-services.md`
  Naming, as Doc-Touch moment 1, before the code change.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green across all four projects; zero remaining `ISpriteService`/
  `FileSystemSpriteService` references repo-wide; live server run booted clean, DI resolved,
  `/`, `/Account/Login`, `/Account/Register` all `200`. Detail in `audit/Sprites.md` Feature 3 L2
  Stage-5 note.
- **Tool:** Opus (reconcile, mechanical). **Pointer:** `audit/Sprites.md` Feature 3 (+ audit-summary §3b).
- **Deps:** WU0.

### WU3 — Tags L2 read service *(Stage-4 trap → build to spec)* — DONE ✓ (2026-06-20)
- **Cells:** 13 L2, 14 L2 — now Stage 5.
- **Done:** renamed `ITagRetrievalService`→`ITagReadService` (`Core/Tags/`); added
  `ServerTagReadService` (`Server/Tags/`, primary-constructor DI over `ReadOnlyApplicationDbContext`,
  `.Select()` projection); registered `AddScoped<ITagReadService, ServerTagReadService>()` in
  `Server/Program.cs`; updated both existing injectors (`TagSelector.razor`,
  `StoryPropertiesForm.razor`). Server-only — no Client/L5 impl (MVP is InteractiveServer-only;
  deferred to post-MVP L5 batch alongside Sprites/Stories L5).
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green across all four projects; zero remaining
  `ITagRetrievalService` references repo-wide; live server run booted clean, DI resolved,
  `/`, `/Account/Login`, `/Account/Register` all `200`. Detail in `audit/Tags.md` Features 13, 14
  Stage-5 notes.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Tags.md` Features 13, 14 + cluster reconciliation note.
- **Deps:** WU0.

### WU4 — `TagChip` leaf — DONE ✓ (2026-06-21)
- **Cells:** 13 L3/L3.5/L4 — now Stage 5.
- **Done:** minted `TagChipDto` (Core/Tags/ — `TagId`, `TagName`, `TagTypeId`, `Description`,
  `SpriteUrl`); built `TagChip` (`SharedUI/Tags/`) as a pure leaf taking `Tag` (the DTO) +
  `EventCallback OnRemove`, no service injection. Settled (doc-touched into `layer2-services.md`
  before the build, per Doc-Touch moment 1): sprite URLs are resolved **server-side, in the
  producing read service's projection** via `ISpriteReadService.GetSpriteUrl`, mirroring
  `StoryListingDto.CoverArtRelativeUrl` — `TagChipDto.SpriteUrl` is a resolved relative path, not the
  raw `SpriteIdentifier` key, and is request-scoped (never cached cross-user/theme). Also fixed stale
  examples found along the way: `layer4-style.md`'s "Sprite Resolution" (wrong `GetSpriteUrl` arg
  order/path, referenced the dropped `GetInteractionIcon`) and `layer3.5-structure.md`'s canonical
  `TagChip` snippet (now takes `TagChipDto Tag`); added the tag-type color table to `layer4-style.md`
  Pattern Accumulation. No producing read service/consumer exists yet — verified via a throwaway demo
  harness on `HomeDesktop.razor` (removed once WU11/WU13 land).
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (4 projects); user-confirmed visual check against the live server
  (all six tag-type colors, sprite render, tooltip, conditional X button, no doubled spacing). Detail
  in `audit/Tags.md` Feature 13 Stage-5 note.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Tags.md` Feature 13 + `layer2-services.md`
  §"Sprite URLs Are Resolved Server-Side, At Projection Time". **Deps:** WU2, WU3.

### WU5 — `RichTextView` leaf — DONE ✓ (2026-06-21)
- **Cells:** 7 L3.5/L4 (RichTextView slice only — `ChapterPage`/`ChapterNavigation` remain, WU18/WU26;
  cell numbers in `status.md` unchanged).
- **Done:** built `RichTextView` (`SharedUI/RichText/`, a new cross-cutting cluster like `Lookups/` —
  not filed under Chapters, since it's universal across Chapters/Comments/Recommendations/BlogPosts/
  Profiles/Messaging). Pure leaf, no service injection, no sanitization (trusts stored HTML;
  sanitize-on-save is WU6/L2's job, §3.21). Reader display settings arrive via a cascaded slim
  property bag, `ReaderDisplaySettings` (`SharedUI/RichText/`, deliberately not a `*Dto` — never
  crosses the service boundary), with built-in defaults when no cascade provider is present.
  `ReaderSettings` (Core) is unchanged — settled as a deliberate non-split (separation happens at the
  consumption layer, not storage). No border/background on the leaf (Container Composite/`Card`
  concern, owned by the composing context). Doc-Touch moment 1 (before the build): `SKILL.md` Code
  Organization (new `RichText/` cluster rule), `layer3.5-structure.md` ("Ambient Viewer Settings via
  Cascading Slim Bags" pattern), `layer4-style.md` ("Reader Settings as CSS" rewritten for the
  cascaded bag + Pattern Accumulation entry), `layer2-services.md` (sanitize-once-on-save trust
  boundary). The layout-level cascade *provider* (reading the real viewer's `User.ReaderSettings`) is
  deferred to its first real consumer (WU26/WU30), not wired here.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (4 projects); live server run, homepage `200`; throwaway harness
  on `HomeDesktop.razor` confirmed both a non-default cascaded `ReaderDisplaySettings` and the
  no-cascade default path render correct inline styles + unescaped HTML; harness removed after
  confirmation. Detail in `audit/Chapters.md` Feature 7 WU5 Stage note.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Chapters.md` Feature 7. **Deps:** WU0.

### WU6 — `EditorView` composite *(third-party Quill wrapper)* — DONE ✓ (2026-06-21)
- **Cells:** 6 L3-Logic, L3.5-Structure, L4-Style — now Stage 5 (6 L2 stays Stage 2 — sanitizer minted,
  no call site yet).
- **Done:** `EditorView` (`SharedUI/RichText/EditorView.razor`) wrapping Blazored TextEditor 1.1.3
  (Quill.js); minted `IHtmlSanitizationService`/`ServerHtmlSanitizationService` (`HtmlSanitizer`
  9.0.892, allow-list = exactly the toolbar's output set, `AddSingleton`). Two settled deviations from
  the original sketch: **no `Compact` runtime toggle** — Quill binds toolbar listeners once at
  construction, so a later `ToolbarContent` change doesn't rewire them; the device axis is deferred to
  a future separate desktop/mobile composition instead (MVP ships desktop toolbar only, not
  MVP-blocking), matching how the rest of the codebase handles desktop/mobile. **Preview is a popup
  overlay, not an in-place swap** — swapping reflowed the page every toggle; Quill now stays mounted
  continuously and `RichTextView` renders on top of a dimmed backdrop. Inline Pokémon-sprite Quill
  blot (spec §5.30.2) stays out of scope, its own future work-unit. Doc-Touch (moment 1, before the
  build): `layer2-services.md` "The allow-list is the inverse of the toolbar"; `layer3.5-structure.md`
  "Third-Party Wrapper Composite" (corrected the snippet's nonexistent `@bind-Value` to the real
  Blazored API and the popup pattern); `layer4-style.md` (fixed a stale `RichTextEditor`→`EditorView`
  naming mismatch); `cross-cutting.md` (flagged mobile toolbar deferred).
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (4 projects, 0 warnings); live server run, homepage `200`; NuGet
  restore + build confirmed both `Blazored.TextEditor` and `HtmlSanitizer` work on net10.0; throwaway
  harness + a throwaway dev-diagnostics endpoint confirmed the sanitizer strips
  `<script>`/event-handlers/`javascript:` hrefs while preserving allowed formatting; user-confirmed
  visual check against the live server (toolbar functional, preview popup opens/closes without page
  reflow, content captured correctly). Harness and diagnostic endpoint removed after confirmation.
  Detail in `audit/Chapters.md` Feature 6 WU6 Stage note.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Chapters.md` Feature 6. **Deps:** WU0.

### WU7 — `UserStoryInteractionButton` leaf — DONE ✓ (2026-06-21)
- **Cells:** 16 L3/L3.5/L4 — now Stage 5 (button slice only; panel slice + debounce remain Stage 2,
  owned by WU16).
- **Done:** EventCallback-driven (absence of `OnToggle` ⇒ read-only, rendered only when `IsActive`);
  built as a square 3-state button (gray inactive → accent-fill-on-hover → inverted accent-bg/white-
  shape when active). Icon comes in as **inline SVG**, not a resolved sprite URL — `IconPath` (SVG
  `d` string) + `AccentColor` `[Parameter]`s, plus `Label` for `aria-label`/`title` (a11y gap the
  spec's 3-param contract didn't cover). The button itself injects no service and has no
  `InteractionTypeEnum` knowledge. Settled (WU7, Doc-Touch moment 1 before the build, supersedes the
  WU2-era sprite-key plan): interaction icons are inline SVG, permanently — carved out of the "never
  inline SVG" rule, which still governs tags/covers/avatars. The owning `UserStoryInteractionPanel`
  (WU16) maps `InteractionTypeEnum` → `(IconPath, AccentColor)` — that mapping table is the one
  remaining open item, left for WU16. `Sprites.ISpriteReadService.GetSpriteUrl` is not involved.
  Updated `layer3-logic.md`, `layer3.5-structure.md`, `layer4-style.md` (new "Interaction Icons Are
  Inline SVG" section + Pattern Accumulation entry), `audit/UserStoryInteractions.md`, `audit/Sprites.md`.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (4 projects); user-confirmed visual check against the live
  server (all 3 states, hover fill, read-only visibility-when-active-only) via a throwaway harness
  on `HomeDesktop.razor` (removed after confirmation). Detail in `audit/UserStoryInteractions.md`
  Feature 16 Stage notes.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/UserStoryInteractions.md` Feature 16. **Deps:** none (the
  original WU2 dependency assumed sprite-based icons; inline SVG removed that coupling).

### WU8 — `PaginationControls` — DONE ✓ (2026-06-21; markup-level regression test added 2026-06-22). Note: visual box for active page (CSS custom property rendering) not verified in bUnit — requires human sign-off against live app for Stage 6.
- **Cells:** 31 L3.5/L4 (pagination slice) — built; cell numbers in `status.md` unchanged (slice
  only, rest of Feature 31 remains Stage 2/1 — see audit note).
- **Done:** built as a leaf (`SharedUI/Pagination/PaginationControls.razor`) per spec §3.11.1 —
  the `audit-summary.md` "Composite" tag is stale, superseded. Greenfield contract:
  `CurrentPage`/`PageSize`/`TotalCount` (primitives only) + `EventCallback<int> OnPageChanged`;
  stateless offset pagination (§5.3.4) — raises the requested page, never queries. Fixed 7-slot
  sliding window (first/last always shown, ellipsis fills gaps at `TotalPages > 7`; all pages shown,
  centered in the same reserved width, at `TotalPages <= 7`) so the control's total width never
  shifts between listings. Not used in random-discovery mode ("give me more" + interaction buttons
  remain the mechanism there). Two rounds of user-driven visual refinement after the initial build:
  summary text moved below the button row, buttons made into bordered solid blocks with hover
  shading (the active-page "doesn't look active" note traced to the demo not updating on click, not
  a styling gap), and the fixed-width windowing added to stop the footprint shifting page-to-page.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (4 projects); user-confirmed visual check against the live
  server via a throwaway harness on `HomeDesktop.razor` (12-page sliding window, 3-page no-ellipsis/
  centered, single-page renders nothing, active highlight follows clicks) — harness removed after
  confirmation. Detail in `audit/Discovery.md` Feature 31 WU8 Stage note and `layer4-style.md`
  Pattern Accumulation.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Discovery.md`. **Deps:** WU0.

### WU9 — `ConfirmDialog` *(universal container, §5.30.9)* — DONE ✓ (2026-06-21)
- **Cells:** 26 L3.5 — now Stage 5 (26 L4 stays Stage 1 — spoiler blur/cover styling, owned by WU20).
- **Done:** built `ConfirmDialog` (new `SharedUI/Dialogs/` cross-cutting cluster — no owning feature,
  mirrors `RichText/`/`Lookups/`). Contract settled (confirmed with user before build): `@bind-IsOpen`
  (two-way `IsOpen`/`IsOpenChanged`) rather than an imperative `@ref`-driven `ShowAsync()`, matching the
  `_showConfirmDialog` bool in the spec's spoiler example (`layer3-logic.md` "Spoiler Comment State").
  `Title`/`Message` for simple bodies, `ChildContent` for rich bodies (wins over `Message`),
  `ConfirmText`/`CancelText`, `IsDestructive` (red `bg-danger` confirm button vs. green `bg-primary`),
  `OnConfirm`/`OnCancel` EventCallbacks. Renders nothing when `!IsOpen`; backdrop click cancels, panel
  uses `@onclick:stopPropagation`. Overlay shell reuses the convention `EditorView`'s preview popup
  already established (backdrop `bg-black/50` + `rounded-xl bg-surface shadow-lg` panel) — not
  refactored into a further shared `Modal` primitive (only two consumers, two different flows; deferred
  until a third clarifies the shared part). Doc-Touch moment 1 (before the build):
  `canalave-conventions/SKILL.md` Code Organization (new `Dialogs/` cluster rule);
  `layer3.5-structure.md` (second Container Composite worked example + updated `EditorView` cross-ref);
  `layer4-style.md` Pattern Accumulation (modal shell convention recorded once).
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (4 projects, 0 new warnings); `npm run css:build` picked up
  `bg-danger` (theme token pre-existed, just unused until now); live server run, homepage `200`;
  user-confirmed visual check via a throwaway harness on `HomeDesktop.razor` (message-only dialog,
  `ChildContent` dialog, `IsDestructive` variant, backdrop-click + Confirm/Cancel all round-tripping
  `@bind-IsOpen`) — harness removed immediately after confirmation (self-contained, unlike WU4's
  TagChip harness which stood in for an unbuilt producer). Detail in `audit/Comments.md` Feature 26
  WU9 Stage-5 note.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Comments.md` Feature 26. **Deps:** WU0.

### WU10 — `UserCard` leaf — DONE ✓ (2026-06-21)
- **Cells:** 18 L3.5/L4 — now Stage 5.
- **Done:** minted `UserCardDto`/`UserCardBadgeDto` (`Core/Users/`) and built `UserCard`
  (`SharedUI/Users/`) as a pure leaf, in a new cross-cutting `Users/` cluster (same `RichText/`-shaped
  exception as `Dialogs/` — no single feature owns the atom; doc-touched into `SKILL.md` "Code
  Organization" before the build). Settled and built per spec §5.30.7: View Profile is a plain
  always-on link; the remaining caret actions (Discover from this User, Copy link, Report, Send PM)
  are optional `EventCallback`s gated by `HasDelegate` — Report (WU34)/Send PM (WU35) stay dark until
  those features land. Badge collection minted on the DTO now, rendered conditionally (empty until
  WU36). Avatar is `User.ProfilePictureRelativeUrl` copied verbatim by the producing read service, not
  `ISpriteReadService.GetSpriteUrl` — corrected a stale overgeneralization in `layer4-style.md`
  (Doc-Touch before the build); added a static `wwwroot/img/default-avatar.svg` fallback. Contract
  feeds vouch display (WU21), profiles (WU30), and other listed consumers.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (4 projects, 0 warnings); live server run, homepage `200`;
  user-confirmed visual check against the live server (avatar fallback, linked username, conditional
  tagline/badges, caret open/close, HasDelegate-gated menu items, no doubled spacing) via a throwaway
  harness on `HomeDesktop.razor` (removed after confirmation). Detail in `audit/Following.md`
  Feature 18 Stage-5 note. Consumers (WU21/WU30/…) remain Stage 2 — the DTO contract alone doesn't
  flip them, same as WU4's `TagChip`.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Following.md` Feature 18 + `audit/Profiles.md`.
  **Deps:** WU2 (sprite/avatar).

### WU11 — `TagSelector` composite rebuild *(Stage-4 trap → spec §5.30.4)* — DONE ✓ (2026-06-22)
- **Cells:** 14 L3/L3.5/L4 — now Stage 5 (14 L2 was already Stage 5 from WU3, extended additively).
- **Done:** discarded the datalist/list-mutation/inline-badge component entirely; rebuilt around
  single-select **Blazored.Typeahead** 4.7.0 (300ms debounce, `MinimumLength=2`) sourced by a new,
  additive `ITagReadService.SearchTagChipsAsync(type, term)` (capped per-keystroke server search via
  `EF.Functions.ILike`, sprites resolved post-materialization through `ISpriteReadService` — Npgsql
  doesn't translate the `string.Contains(string, StringComparison)` overload, caught at build time).
  Selected chips render as `TagChip` leaves above the input; dropdown rows are lightweight (color dot +
  sprite + name). Settled (Doc-Touch moment 1, before the build): the typeahead sources per-keystroke
  from the server rather than loading a type's full tag set upfront; `OnSelectionChanged` emits
  `IReadOnlyList<TagChipDto>`, not the spec's literal `IReadOnlyList<Tag>` (DTO Firewall forbids the EF
  entity crossing into UI). Fixed the `mb-4` outer-margin violation. **Real bug found and fixed during
  verification, not anticipated in the plan:** `BlazoredTypeahead` requires a `SelectedTemplate`
  parameter — omitting it throws in `OnInitialized()`, which kills the Blazor Server circuit
  immediately (symptom: field permanently unresponsive, page frozen on prerendered markup — looked
  exactly like "can't type into the box," not like a missing-parameter exception). A secondary
  `Dispose()` `NullReferenceException` was a downstream symptom of that same half-init state, not a
  separate prerendering incompatibility — an earlier mid-build doc note misdiagnosed it as one and
  added an unnecessary `RendererInfo.IsInteractive` guard, since removed once the real cause was found.
  Updated `layer2-services.md`, `layer3-logic.md`, `layer3.5-structure.md` (canonical snippet +
  the SelectedTemplate pitfall), `layer4-style.md` (dot-color table + package CSS-skeleton note),
  `audit/Tags.md` Feature 14.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (4 projects, 0 errors); live server run, homepage `200`, clean
  boot/request cycles with no exceptions. User-confirmed visual + interactive check on the live server
  via a throwaway `HomeDesktop.razor` harness (two `TagSelector` instances, Character + Genre, backed
  by 7 throwaway fixture `Tag` rows inserted via `psql`): debounced dropdown rows, chip add/remove,
  already-selected exclusion, no doubled spacing. Harness and fixture rows removed after confirmation.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Tags.md` Feature 14 + cluster note. **Deps:** WU3, WU4.

## Phase 2 — Integration Points

### WU12 — Stories L2 (listing + write completion) — DONE ✓ (2026-06-22)
- **Cells:** 5 L2 — now Stage 5 (was Stage 2 — minted `StoryListingDto` + listing/browse projection +
  content-rating master filter "mature off ⇒ no trace"). 4 L2 — stays Stage 5 (slug generation built;
  create-path NRE fixed; cover-art *storage* infra built, upload UI still open → WU24).
- **Done:** content-rating filter landed as a global EF named query filter on `Story`
  (`ApplicationDbContext.OnModelCreating`, named `"ContentRating"`), sourced from a new scoped
  `IActiveUserContext` (`Core/Identity/` + `Server/Identity/ServerActiveUserContext.cs` — claims-only,
  `IHttpContextAccessor` primary / `AuthenticationStateProvider` fallback, lazy-resolved property to
  dodge `SecurityStampValidator`'s early-middleware DbContext resolution — see the class's own XML doc
  for the full reasoning). Listing scope landed exactly as settled: `StoryListingDto` +
  `GetListingsByIdsAsync(int[])` (the §6.6 building block) + `GetRecentListingsAsync(page, pageSize)`
  (one unfiltered-by-criteria browse projection); `GetListingsAsync(StoryFilterDto)` stays deferred to
  WU23. **Cover-art storage infra built, not stubbed:** minted `IImageStorageService` +
  `LocalImageStorageService` (wwwroot-backed, host-relative URLs) — see `audit/ImageStorage.md` — so
  `StoryCard` (WU13) has a real cover URL. The write path still treats `CoverArtRelativeUrl` as a
  pass-through string (no upload UI yet — that's WU24); the cloud backend (`S3ImageStorageService`,
  R2/MinIO) is the Post-MVP item below, an additive swap behind the same interface. **Two real bugs
  found and fixed in the write path, not anticipated in the plan:** a NRE in `StoryMappers.ToStory()` (a
  fresh `new Story()` had null `StoryListing`/`StoryDetail` navs, dereferenced before the partitions
  were attached — fixed by initializing both navs on create) and a compounding bug in
  `CreateStoryAsync`'s use of `writeDb.Attach(...)` on those same navs (`Attach` marks the graph
  Unchanged — would have silently skipped inserting the listing/detail rows even after the NRE was
  fixed; removed, `Stories.Add(newStoryDB)` alone correctly cascades as Added). Also removed the Aspire
  Npgsql EF Core *client* package from `TheCanalaveLibrary.Server` — pooled DbContexts are incompatible
  with `IActiveUserContext`'s Scoped lifetime; plain `AddDbContext` is now the standing registration for
  both DbContexts (see `status.md` Global Conditions, `forward_plan.md`).
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (4 projects, 0 warnings/errors); live server boot clean. Via
  `/dev/wu12/*` diagnostics (`DevDiagnosticsEndpoints.cs`) against fixture data (`TestUser`, fixture
  tags 10/11, test stories 5/6/7) — content filter confirmed both directions (anonymous + non-mature
  user saw only the Teen-rated fixture story; `TestUser` with `ShowMatureContent=true` saw all 4
  including Mature); `GetListingsByIdsAsync` confirmed reorder-to-input-order + silent-drop of
  filtered ids; `CreateStoryAsync` called twice with the same title produced disambiguated slugs
  (`wu12-mature-story`, `wu12-mature-story-2`), no NRE; `LocalImageStorageService.SaveAsync` round-
  tripped a 1x1 PNG to `/uploads/stories/999/cover-{uuid}.png`, served back `200 image/png`
  byte-identical. **Deviation from plan, deliberate, user-instructed:** the plan's step 4 ("remove the
  diagnostic endpoint + fixtures after confirmation") was *not* done — the user explicitly said to keep
  the `/dev/wu12/*` endpoints standing and keep all fixture data (test stories, fixture tags, the
  uploaded test image) for later analysis. These are not real seeded content; future sessions should
  not mistake story ids 5/6/7/999 or tag ids 10/11 for production seed data.

### WU12.5 — Test Foundation (unit + integration test projects) — DONE ✓ (2026-06-22)
- **Cells:** none directly — cross-cutting tooling, not a feature cell. Follows directly from a
  post-WU12 post-mortem: WU12's two create-path bugs were caught only by a human reading
  `/dev/wu12/*` probe output, which asserts nothing.
- **Done:** minted `TheCanalaveLibrary.Tests.Unit` (xUnit, references Core only — no DB/host) and
  `TheCanalaveLibrary.Tests.Integration` (xUnit + `Testcontainers.PostgreSql` +
  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing`, references Server), both added to the `.sln`. See
  `canalave-conventions/testing.md` for the convention (two test tiers, why integration tests use a
  real Postgres container rather than EF InMemory/SQLite, the fake-`IActiveUserContext` pattern).
  Extracted the pure `Slugify` transform out of `ServerStoryWriteService` into
  `Core/Stories/StorySlug.cs` (unit-testable, no DbContext) — `GenerateUniqueSlugAsync` still owns the
  DB uniqueness scan. Added `public partial class Program;` to `Server/Program.cs` so
  `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` can reference it from the test assembly. Integration infra:
  `PostgresFixture` (one Testcontainers Postgres per collection, migrated via `Database.MigrateAsync()`
  — not `EnsureCreated()`), `TestAppFactory` (boots the real `Program.cs` host, swaps the real
  `ServerActiveUserContext` registration for a settable `FakeActiveUserContext`, redirects
  `IWebHostEnvironment.WebRootPath` to a per-factory temp folder so image tests never touch the real
  `wwwroot/uploads/`). Migrated the WU12 dev-diagnostics probes into asserted tests: content-rating
  filter both directions + `GetListingsByIdsAsync` reorder/drop (`ContentRatingFilterTests`), the
  create-path NRE/Attach-vs-Add/slug-disambiguation regressions (`StoryWriteServiceTests`),
  `GetRecentListingsAsync` ordering (`RecentListingsTests`), the image round-trip + delete +
  path-traversal guard (`ImageStorageServiceTests`), and a DI-resolution sanity check
  (`HostBootTests`). The `/dev/wu12/*` endpoints and their fixtures stay in place (per the WU12 user
  instruction) but are no longer the source of truth for these behaviors — see testing.md "Dev-
  diagnostics endpoints are probes, not the regression net."
- **Real bug found and fixed while building this, not anticipated in the plan:** the first version of
  `RecentListingsTests` dated its fixture rows "now + 10 years" expecting them to sort to the top of
  `GetRecentListingsAsync`'s unfiltered listing regardless of other accumulated rows in the shared
  Postgres container. That isn't isolation-proof: a leftover row from an *earlier, separate*
  `dotnet test` process invocation against the same container computes its own "+10 years" from an
  earlier wall-clock instant, and the test failed intermittently when re-run because two
  relatively-dated fixtures from different runs can land in either order relative to each other.
  Fixed by never asserting absolute top-N position against shared/accumulating state — instead fetch
  enough rows to be sure this test's own two known ids are present, then assert only their order
  *relative to each other*. Confirmed stable across three consecutive `dotnet test` invocations after
  the fix.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` on the full `.sln` green (8 projects, 0 warnings/errors). `dotnet test`
  on the full `.sln` green: 25 unit tests (no DB), 15 integration tests (real Testcontainers Postgres,
  ~4s). Sanity check that the tests actually guard the invariant, not vacuously green: temporarily
  changed the `"ContentRating"` query filter in `ApplicationDbContext.OnModelCreating` to ignore
  `ShowMatureContent` (`s => s.Rating <= Rating.M` unconditionally) — 3 of 5 `ContentRatingFilterTests`
  failed as expected; reverted, full suite green again. No Docker containers left running after any
  run (Testcontainers' Ryuk reaper cleans up correctly).
- **2026-06-22 backfill addendum — methodology tightening + test taxonomy overhaul + service + component
  backfill.** Post-evaluation of WU12.5 found two gaps: (1) testing was never woven into the governing
  methodology (CLAUDE.md loops, Doc-Touch moment 3, audit Stage-5 rows all silent about tests); (2) the
  Unit/Integration tier boundary was mis-modeled as a reference-graph proxy ("Unit = Core refs only")
  that barred host-free Server services. Both fixed in one pass:
  - **Methodology docs updated (advisory — no Stage gate):** CLAUDE.md Doc-Touch moment 3 now runs
    `dotnet test` and records the covering tier (Unit/Integration/RazorComponents) or states why none
    applies; Per-Stage "After completing any work-unit" now names `dotnet test`; audit Stage-5 row
    strengthened to require tier name or rationale. `workplan.md` per-unit loop and `forward_plan.md`
    Phase E loop now include `dotnet test` and the tier-recording step (both identical so they don't
    drift). `testing.md` rewritten: three tiers by *kind* (Unit = directly-constructed, no host/DB,
    refs Core + Server; Integration = WebApplicationFactory/Testcontainers Postgres; RazorComponents =
    bUnit render tests — no host, no DB). `Tests.Unit.csproj` now references Server (enabling
    host-free Server-service unit tests; "no DbContext in Unit" is a convention guardrail, not a
    reference-graph constraint). `SKILL.md` description updated to surface testing.
  - **New test project:** `TheCanalaveLibrary.Tests.RazorComponents` (bUnit 1.33.3 + xUnit + FluentAssertions,
    references SharedUI; added to `.sln`). JSInterop.Loose for Blazored.Typeahead.
  - **Test backfill — Unit tier (`Tests.Unit`):** `HtmlSanitizationServiceTests` (WU5/WU6 —
    `ServerHtmlSanitizationService` directly constructed; covers all 11 allowed tags, `<script>`
    stripping, anchor normalization, scheme filtering, CSS/class stripping, whitespace guard); one
    production fix found: guard was `IsNullOrEmpty` — changed to `IsNullOrWhiteSpace`. `SpriteReadServiceTests`
    (WU2 — `ServerSpriteReadService` with `FakeWebHostEnvironment`; covers animated/static/unknown
    fallback, theme path).
  - **Test backfill — Integration tier (`Tests.Integration`):** `TagReadServiceTests` (WU3/WU11 —
    `ITagReadService` via `TestAppFactory` scope; covers ILike, alphabetical order, cap, SpriteUrl null,
    type filter, relative assertions). `UserDeletionServiceTests` (WU1 Feature 52 — highest-value
    FK-invariant test: all four Restrict edges verified against real Postgres via `UserManager<User>`;
    covers null SourceUserId, cascade-deleted UserStat, FollowedUser/Vouch/UserProfileComment cleanup,
    FK-violation-free execution).
  - **Test backfill — RazorComponents tier (`Tests.RazorComponents`):** `PaginationControlsTests` (WU8 —
    page-window math, active-page markup `aria-current`/CSS token, Prev/Next disabled, range summary,
    callback; CSS custom property rendering remains manual-only for Stage 6); `TagChipTests` (WU4);
    `TagSelectorTests` (WU11 — pre-selected chip render/remove, `OnSelectionChanged`; add-via-typeahead
    is manual-only per bUnit JS limitation); `UserCardTests` (WU10).
  - **Mutation sanity confirmed for all three new suites:** (1) `<script>` added to allow-list →
    `Sanitize_ScriptTag_IsStrippedCompletely` fails; (2) Notification SetNull commented out →
    `DeleteUserAsync_NullsOutSourceUserId_OnNotificationsSentByThisUser` fails; (3) `aria-current`
    condition inverted → 3 `PaginationControlsTests` fail. All reverted; suite green.
  - **Final counts:** 62 Unit + 33 Integration + 41 RazorComponents = **136 tests total**, all passing.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `canalave-conventions/testing.md`, `forward_plan.md` "Test
  strategy" Resolved entry. **Deps:** WU12.

### WU15 — UserStoryInteractions L2 (writes + per-viewer state reads) *(reordered before WU13 — 2026-06-22)* — DONE ✓ (2026-06-22)
- **Cells:** 16 L2 → Stage 5; 16 L6 → Stage 5 (indexes already correct, verified during WU15);
  17 L6 → Stage 5 (same index file). **17 L2 stays Stage 2 — deferred to WU27**.
- **Done:** `Core/UserStoryInteractions/` cluster (enum, constants, DTOs, interfaces);
  `Server/UserStoryInteractions/` (read + write impls, CQRS-lite inheritance); DI in `Program.cs`.
  15 integration tests (`UserStoryInteractionServiceTests`, Testcontainers Postgres): upsert, date
  partition stamping/clearing, HasStarted preservation, sparse cleanup + cascade, `GetStatesByStoryIdsAsync`
  user-scoping, all-false default, anonymous context empty-read + write guard.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (8 projects, 0 errors). `dotnet test` green: 236 total
  (93 Integration / 79 Unit / 64 RazorComponents). Detail in `audit/UserStoryInteractions.md` Feature 16 L2 Stage-5 note.

### WU16 — `UserStoryInteractionPanel` composite *(reordered before WU13 — 2026-06-22)* — DONE ✓ (2026-06-22)
- **Cells:** 16 L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5. 17 L3.5 stays Stage 2.
- **Done:** `Core/UserStoryInteractions/InteractionDisplayContext.cs` (enum: `Listing|Detail`);
  `SharedUI/UserStoryInteractions/InteractionVisuals.cs` (static class, inner `Info` record, verbatim
  audit table transcription); `SharedUI/UserStoryInteractions/UserStoryInteractionPanel.razor` (iterates
  `Enum.GetValues<InteractionTypeEnum>()` for locked button order; debounce via CTS + Task.Delay;
  optimistic local state; `IDisposable`; listing visibility rule: blank-slate OR already active for
  ReadLater/Ignore). `Tests.RazorComponents/FakeUserStoryInteractionWriteService.cs` +
  `UserStoryInteractionPanelTests.cs` (13 tests). `Tests.Unit/InteractionVisualsTests.cs` (26 tests).
  **Discovery**: Blazor renders bool `aria-pressed="@bool"` as a boolean HTML attribute (absent when
  false, empty string when true) — tests use `HasAttribute("aria-pressed")` not string comparison.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (8 projects, 0 errors). `dotnet test` green: 275 total
  (105 Unit / 77 RazorComponents / 93 Integration). Detail in `audit/UserStoryInteractions.md`
  Feature 16 L3/L3.5/L4 Stage-5 notes.

### WU13 — `StoryCard` leaf *(moved after WU15+WU16 — 2026-06-22)* — DONE ✓ (2026-06-23)
- **Cells:** 5 L3/L3.5/L4 (card slice only — cells stay 4/4/1; StoryPage dispatcher, StoryDesktop/Mobile,
  and StoryDeck still hold those cells).
- **Done:** Step 0 — renamed `StoryInteractionPanel` → `UserStoryInteractionPanel` (component file,
  test file, `FakeUserStoryInteractionWriteService` xref, all doc/skill/audit references). Step 1 —
  additive `StoryListingDto.ShortDescription (string?)` extension (warm-partition projection, no migration;
  `StoryListingRow` + `ProjectListingRows` + `ToDto` updated in `ServerStoryReadService`). Step 2 —
  built `SharedUI/Stories/StoryCard.razor` as a pure leaf: `[EditorRequired] StoryListingDto Story` +
  `UserStoryInteractionStateDto? InteractionState` + `bool IsOwnStory` + 4 gated `EventCallback`s
  (Discover, CopyLink, Report, Download). Composes `TagChip` (read-only) + `UserStoryInteractionPanel`
  in Listing context. Author byline is a plain hyperlink — NOT `UserCard` (spec §5.30.7). Cover art uses
  stored URL verbatim with `_coverArtFailed` `@onerror` fallback. Status/rating/word-count computed
  display properties; caret with always-present "View Story" link + `HasDelegate`-gated optional items.
  Step 3 — `StoryCardTests.cs` (30 bUnit tests, JSInterop.Loose, registers
  `FakeUserStoryInteractionWriteService`): title link, author link/plain-text, tags, ShortDescription
  tooltip/null, word-count theory (8 cases), cover-art fallback, status/rating badge theories, panel
  composition (blank-slate + IsOwnStory), caret gating.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (8 projects, 0 errors). `dotnet test` green: 105 Unit + 107
  RazorComponents + 109 Integration = 321 total. RazorComponents tier covers the StoryCard surface
  (30 new tests); L4-Style visual sign-off pending (requires live server check per the plan — see
  audit/Stories.md Feature 5 WU13 slice note). Mints the StoryCard contract → WU14 (`StoryDeck`) now
  has its key dep satisfied. Detail in `audit/Stories.md` Feature 5 WU13 slice note.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Stories.md` Feature 5 + audit-summary §5.
  **Deps:** WU4, WU7, WU12, WU16.

### WU14 — `StoryDeck` composite *(pass-through)* — DONE ✓ (2026-06-23)
- **Cells:** 5 L3.5/L4 (deck slice only — cells remain Stage 4/1 because `StoryPage`
  dispatcher + `StoryDesktop`/`StoryMobile` still hold them → WU25; narrative in
  `audit/Stories.md` Feature 5 WU14 note).
- **Done:** built `SharedUI/Stories/StoryDeck.razor` as a pass-through layout composite (no service
  injection). Three-state internally: `null` → loading text, empty list → customisable `EmptyMessage`,
  populated → `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6` of `StoryCard` + unconditional
  `PaginationControls` (self-hides at `TotalPages ≤ 1`). Contract: `[EditorRequired]
  IReadOnlyList<StoryListingDto>? Stories`, `IReadOnlyDictionary<int, UserStoryInteractionStateDto>?
  InteractionStates` (keyed by StoryId, batch-loaded by parent), `int? CurrentUserId` (deck computes
  `IsOwnStory` per card), `string EmptyMessage` (default "No stories found."), pagination forwards.
  Caret callbacks deferred — additive when first consumer (WU28/34/38) needs them.
  Pre-implementation doc-touch (moment 1/2): fixed duplicate StoryDeck paragraph and contradictory
  Loading States example in `layer3.5-structure.md`; added StoryDeck Pattern Accumulation entry to
  `layer4-style.md`. **Real insight during verification:** in Listing context, non-ReadLater/Ignore
  active buttons render as `<span>` (read-only, no `OnToggle` delegate) rather than `<button>` with
  `aria-pressed` — so the forwarding test asserts `span[aria-label="Favorite"]` appears when
  `IsFavorite=true`, not `aria-pressed`.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (8 projects, 0 warnings/errors). `dotnet test` green: 381 total
  (112 Unit + 136 RazorComponents + 133 Integration). Mutation sanity: inverted populated-branch
  condition → 6 `StoryDeckTests` fail; reverted. L4 visual sign-off pending live-server check
  (Stage-6 gate). Test tier: RazorComponents (`StoryDeckTests.cs`, 14 tests).

### WU17 — Chapters L2 (writing/versioning + reading) — DONE ✓ (2026-06-22)
- **Cells:** 6 L2, 7 L2 — both now Stage 5.
- **Done:** Minted `Core/Chapters/` cluster (moved `Chapter`/`ChapterContent` from `Core/Models/`) and
  `Server/Chapters/`. New files: `ChapterText.cs` (word-count helper, strips HTML+decodes entities
  before whitespace-split), 5 DTOs, `ChapterValidations/ChapterValidationException`, `IChapterReadService`,
  `IChapterWriteService : IChapterReadService`, `ServerChapterReadService` (primary-ctor, `ReadOnlyApplicationDbContext`),
  `ServerChapterWriteService : ServerChapterReadService` (two-SaveChanges circular-FK break for create).
  Migration `20260623005108_MakeChapterPrimaryContentIdNullable` (made `PrimaryContentId` a `long?`).
  Two bugs found during implementation: (1) async-scope bug in test helpers (`using IServiceScope` +
  `return Task<>` without `await` → "reader is closed"; fixed to `async`/`await`); (2) `SelectMany`
  + outer `OrderBy` on projected DTO can't be translated by EF Core — fixed by moving `OrderBy` inside
  the inner query on the entity field.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green; `dotnet test` 50/50 green (Unit: `ChapterTextTests` 14 tests;
  Integration: `ChapterWriteServiceTests` 8 tests + `ChapterReadServiceTests` 8 tests). Mutation-sanity:
  `"script"` added to allow-list → `SanitizesScriptTag` fails; reverted. Server boot: `200` on homepage
  and `/Account/Login`. Detail in `audit/Chapters.md` Features 6, 7 Stage-5 notes.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Chapters.md` Features 6, 7. **Deps:** WU12.

### WU18 — `ChapterNavigation` composite — DONE ✓ (2026-06-23)
- **Cells:** 7 L3.5/L4 (nav slice) — now Stage 5.
- **Done:** `SharedUI/Chapters/ChapterNavigation.razor` — injection-free coordination composite
  (spec §5.30.3). Four concerns inline (no sub-components): prev/next `<a>`/`<span aria-disabled>`
  links; chapter-select `<details>` disclosure with per-entry alt-version indicator
  (`HasAlternateVersions`); version picker `<details>` (rendered only when `Versions.Count > 1`);
  current chapter/version highlighted via `aria-current="page"`. Navigation is anchor hrefs (Blazor
  Router intercepts — no full page reload; no NavigationManager injection). Minted parameter contract
  for WU26 dispatcher. Doc-Touch: `layer3.5-structure.md` Pass-Through snippet updated to real shape;
  `layer4-style.md` Pattern Accumulation entry added.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green; `dotnet test` 336 total (105 Unit / 122 RazorComponents /
  109 Integration). Covering tier: **RazorComponents** (13 tests in `ChapterNavigationTests.cs`).
  Visual/L4 sign-off pending (Stage 6), human check against live server via throwaway harness before
  or during WU26. Detail in `audit/Chapters.md` Feature 7 WU18 Stage note.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Chapters.md` Feature 7. **Deps:** WU17.

### WU19 — Comments L2 (posting / display / likes / spoiler) — DONE ✓ (2026-06-23)
- **Cells:** 23 L2, 24 L2, 25 L2, 26 L2 → Stage 5. Also closed: 25 L1 → Stage 5 (stale-code trap;
  explicit `CommentLike` entity built) and 26 L1 gap (added `IsSpoiler` property + migration).
- **Done:** `Core/Comments/` cluster (entities moved from `Core/Models/`, DTOs, interfaces, validations);
  `Server/Comments/ServerCommentReadService` (golden-index pagination, TPT via `ChapterComments` DbSet,
  per-viewer EXISTS subquery for `IsLikedByCurrentUser`) + `ServerCommentWriteService` (Post/Edit/Delete/
  ToggleLike, author-only, sanitize-once-on-save, hard delete + FK cascade). DI registered in `Program.cs`.
  Migration `20260623222518_AddIsSpoilerToChapterComment` applied. `layer2-services.md` stale doc line
  corrected (Moment 1). Tests: 7 Unit (`CommentValidationsTests`), 18 Integration (`CommentWriteServiceTests`),
  6 Integration (`CommentReadServiceTests`) — 367 total green. Server booted clean.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Comments.md`. **Deps:** WU17.

### WU20 — `CommentItem` leaf + `CommentSection` composite — DONE ✓ (2026-06-23)
- **Cells:** 23/24/25/26 L3-Logic/L3.5-Structure/L4-Style → Stage 5.
- **Done:** `CommentEditor` leaf (shared editing surface, `SaveLabel`/`OnCancel.HasDelegate`/`Busy`),
  `CommentItem` leaf (author block, RichTextView↔CommentEditor edit swap, spoiler blur+confirm,
  like/reply/edit/delete affordances gated by `.HasDelegate`+`IsOwnComment`), `CommentSection`
  coordination composite (coordinated-paginated-region injection, paginated load, two-level tree,
  optimistic like reconciliation, delete ConfirmDialog, reply/edit/post composers). 45 new
  RazorComponents tests (11 CommentEditor, 21 CommentItem, 13 CommentSection) + `FakeCommentWriteService`.
  Key lesson: BlazoredTextEditor toolbar renders same-subtree buttons — all CommentEditor button
  selectors use `aria-label` not text-content scanning. L4 sign-off via throwaway harness on
  `HomeDesktop.razor` (server → `200`, harness removed). All 426 tests pass.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Comments.md` Feature 24 Stage-5 note. **Deps:** WU6, WU9, WU19.

### WU21 — Following + Vouches — DONE ✓ (2026-06-22)
- **Cells:** 18 L2/L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5; 19 L1/L2/L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5 (L1 re-verified: `MakeVouchTextUnlimited` migration).
- **Done:** `Core/Following/` + `Server/Following/` CQRS-lite cluster; `IFollowingReadService` /
  `IFollowingWriteService`; `ServerFollowingReadService` (read-replica) + `ServerFollowingWriteService`
  (inherits read, adds write + sanitizer). DTOs: `UserRelationshipStateDto`, `VouchDisplayDto`.
  `FollowingConstants.MaxVouchesPerUser = 5`, `VouchLimitException`. `SharedUI/Following/`:
  `FollowButton.razor`, `VouchButton.razor`, `VouchList.razor` (owner-conditional `IsEditable`).
  Notification seams `// TODO(WU22)`. DI registered in `Program.cs`.
- **Verified:** `dotnet test` green — 79 Unit / 64 RazorComponents / 78 Integration (221 total).
  Integration: `FollowingWriteServiceTests` + `FollowingReadServiceTests`. RazorComponents:
  `FollowButtonTests`, `VouchButtonTests`, `VouchListTests`. Visual/L4 human sign-off pending (WU30).
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Following.md` Features 18, 19. **Deps:** WU10.

### WU22 — Notifications L2 (generation + service) — DONE ✓ (2026-06-23)
- **Cells:** 41 L2, 42 L2, 43 L2 — all now Stage 5.
- **Done:** Deliberated and settled the notification generation mechanism (direct injected call +
  semantic per-event methods + best-effort post-commit + in-app always-on). Minted
  `Core/Notifications/` (`NotificationDto`, `NotificationSettingDto`, `INotificationReadService`,
  `INotificationWriteService`) and `Server/Notifications/` (`ServerNotificationReadService`,
  `ServerNotificationWriteService`). Private `CreateCoreAsync` owns drop-self + dedup invariants.
  Settings are sparse (upsert when differing from defaults; delete row when returning to defaults).
  Wired `// TODO(WU22)` seams in `ServerFollowingWriteService` (`FollowAsync`/`VouchAsync`).
  Corrected two spec deviations: `SourceUserId` is SET NULL (not RESTRICT); §5.18 in-app toggle
  dropped (in-app always-on). Detail in `audit/Notifications.md`, `cross-cutting.md`,
  `layer2-services.md`, `forward_plan.md` Resolved.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (0 errors). `dotnet test` green: 105 Unit + 77 RazorComponents +
  109 Integration = 291 tests total. Integration tier (`Tests.Integration/NotificationServiceTests.cs`,
  Testcontainers Postgres, 16 tests): generation correctness; drop-self; dedup; read/mark/settings
  coverage; end-to-end `FollowAsync` → notification row. Mutation sanity confirmed (drop-self line
  disabled → test fails; reverted).
- **Deferred semantic methods:** `NotifyNewChapterAsync`, `NotifyNewCommentAsync`, etc. — each lands
  co-delivered with its triggering work-unit. The create-core + DAG pattern are in place.

## Phase 3 — Consumers / Pages

### WU23 — `ResultsFilterPanel` composite — DONE ✓ (2026-06-23)
- **Cells:** 31 L3/L3.5 → Stage 5. 31 L4 stays Stage 1 (visual sign-off pending, consistent with
  WU8/WU13 precedent).
- **Done:** Six-phase delivery. Phase 0: `UserStoryInteraction` nomenclature sweep — renamed all
  `Interaction…` identifiers to `UserStoryInteraction…` across Core, SharedUI, Server, and all three
  test projects; §8.7 entity renames (`UserInteractionFilter→UserStoryInteractionFilterType` etc.)
  carried by a data-preserving rename migration (`RenameTable`/`RenameColumn`/raw-SQL
  `RENAME CONSTRAINT` — no drop/recreate). Phase 1: `Core/Discovery/StoryFilterDto.cs` (sealed record)
  + `Core/Tags/TagFilterSelection.cs` (axis emit contract). Phase 2: `SharedUI/Tags/TagFilter.razor`
  (include/exclude axis, cross-dedup, injection-free) +
  `SharedUI/UserStoryInteractions/UserStoryInteractionFilter.razor` (checkbox axis, injection-free).
  Phase 3: `SharedUI/Discovery/ResultsFilterPanel.razor` (assembler, @code-buffered, Apply emits
  `StoryFilterDto`; Relevance hidden without text; default sorts `[DatePublished, Random]`). Phase 4:
  `GetListingsAsync(StoryFilterDto)` added to `IStoryReadService` + implemented in
  `ServerStoryReadService` (two-step: filtered IQueryable → scalar ID page → `GetListingsByIdsAsync`;
  tag AND-include; tag exclude; FTS via `PlainToTsQuery`/`SearchVector.Matches`; viewer-scoped
  interaction exclusion with pre-computed bool constants; sort switch). Phase 5: tests —
  9 Integration (`StoryListingsTests`), 8 RazorComponents (`ResultsFilterPanelTests`),
  7 RazorComponents (`UserStoryInteractionFilterTests`).
- **Verified (2026-06-23):** `dotnet build` green (8 projects, 0 errors). `dotnet test` green:
  112 Unit + 198 RazorComponents + 142 Integration = 452 total. Detail in `audit/Discovery.md`
  Feature 31 WU23 Stage note.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Discovery.md` Feature 31. **Deps:** WU8, WU11.

### WU24 — Story create/edit pages (`StoryEditorPage` + `StoryPropertiesForm` rebuild) — DONE ✓ (2026-06-23)
- **Cells:** 4 L3/L3.5/L4 — all now Stage 5.
- **Architecture settled (WU24 planning, 2026-06-23):** no `AdminControls` component — ownership-conditional
  affordances are inline `@if` on a page-computed bool (settled in `cross-cutting.md`
  "Owner-Conditional Edit Affordances"). Editing is author-only (identity-equality, server-enforced),
  never author-or-mod (moderation is a separate WU34 path). Content-editing pattern for Story/Chapter:
  **view-page / edit-page split** (see `cross-cutting.md` "Two content-editing patterns").
- **Do:**
  - **Doc-touch (moment 1, before code):** update `cross-cutting.md` + `layer3.5-structure.md` with the
    active-user-conditional handling analysis and two-pattern content-editing rule (done pre-WU24 build).
  - **New `StoryEditorPage.razor`** (Server, both `@page "/story/new"` and `@page "/story/{StoryId:int}/edit"`,
    single responsive page). Thin dispatcher: resolves auth, data-loads for edit, maps ViewModel ↔ DTOs,
    hosts `<StoryPropertiesForm>`. On edit: owner redirect/forbidden if `story.AuthorId != currentUserId`
    (UX pre-check; server gate is the real authority).
  - **Rebuild `StoryPropertiesForm.razor`** (presentational — no `@inject`; stays bUnit-testable):
    Bootstrap → Tailwind; `InputTextArea` long-desc → **`EditorView`** (pull-on-submit via `@ref`);
    add Status field; one `<TagSelector>` per `TagTypeEnum` category; `<InputFile>` for cover art;
    delete dead `TagDropDownDTO`/`GetAllCharacterTagsAsync` code.
  - **TagSelector → DTO mapping:** `TagChipDto` ↔ `IStoryTag` with default Priority (no priority UI in MVP).
  - **Cover-art upload ordering:** on create = save story first (get id), then upload to `IImageStorageService`
    + patch `CoverArtRelativeUrl`; on edit = id already exists.
  - **Server-side author gate:** `UpdateStoryAsync` — load story, throw `UnauthorizedAccessException` if
    `story.AuthorId != activeUser.UserId`. `CreateStoryAsync` — stamp `AuthorId` from
    `IActiveUserContext.UserId`, not DTO (drop `AuthorId` from the client-settable DTO).
- **VERIFIED (2026-06-23):** `dotnet build` green (8 projects, 2 pre-existing warnings, 0 new errors).
  `dotnet test` green: 112 Unit + 208 RazorComponents + 145 Integration = 465 total (13 net-new tests).
  Covering tiers: **Integration** — `StoryWriteServiceTests` (3 new tests: `CreateStoryAsync_StampsAuthorId`,
  `UpdateStoryAsync_Owner_CanUpdateTitle`, `UpdateStoryAsync_NonOwner_ThrowsUnauthorizedAccessException`);
  **Integration** — `CommentReadServiceTests` + `CommentWriteServiceTests` backfill (wired separately; in
  comment cluster); **RazorComponents** — `StoryPropertiesFormTests.cs` (10 tests: title input, textarea,
  select, file input, default/custom submit label, valid submit callback, invalid empty-title, server
  validation errors rendered, IsLoading disables button); **RazorComponents** — `TagSelectorTests`/
  `ResultsFilterPanelTests` updated (`GetTagChipsByIdsAsync` stub added to `FakeTagReadService`).
  `Routes.razor` now uses `AuthorizeRouteView` (not `RouteView`) — `[Authorize]` attributes now enforced.
  L4 visual sign-off pending human review.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Stories.md` Feature 4. **Deps:** WU11, WU14.

### WU25 — Story view page (`StoryPage` + desktop/mobile) — DONE ✓ (2026-06-24)
- **Cells:** 5 L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5 (L4 stays Stage 1 pending visual sign-off, per WU13/WU14/WU24 precedent).
- **Architecture (settled WU25, 2026-06-24):** read-only view page (content-editing Pattern 1 — view
  side). Full detail layout per §5.28: title → cover art → long description →
  chapter selection → recommendations. Full metadata row (rating, status, word count, dates, tag chips).
  Author-only "Edit Story" link is an inline `@if` (Owner-Conditional Edit Affordances convention).
  - **`ChapterNavigation` is NOT used here.** That component (WU18) is reading-context-only
    (`CurrentChapterNumber` is `[EditorRequired]`; renders prev/next + a "Chapter N" dropdown).
    The story landing page uses a dedicated **`ChapterList` leaf** (new, `SharedUI/Chapters/`).
  - **`StoryDetailsDTO` extended:** added `int? AuthorId`, `string? CoverArtRelativeUrl`, `Rating Rating`,
    `StoryStatusEnum Status`, `IReadOnlyList<TagChipDto> Tags`. `GetStoryByIdAsync` projection uses
    two-step intermediate row (mirrors listing service) to resolve sprites in memory via `ToTagChip`.
  - **`GetChapterListAsync(int storyId)`** added to `IChapterReadService` + `ServerChapterReadService`.
    Returns `IReadOnlyList<ChapterListEntryDto>` — all chapters with non-primary alternate versions
    as indented sub-rows. Two-step query (chapters + non-primary versions via SelectMany, grouped
    in memory — mirrors `GetChapterVersionsAsync` pattern).
  - **`ChapterList` leaf** (`SharedUI/Chapters/`): `Chapters`, `StoryId`, `ShowDrafts`. Primary
    chapter row → `/story/{id}/{ch}`; non-primary alternates indented beneath as `Title - VersionName`
    → `/story/{id}/{ch}/{versionOrder}`. Same vertical structure on desktop and mobile.
  - **`[PersistentState]`** on `Story` and `Chapters` in `StoryPage` (kills prerender flicker).
  - **Route:** `/story/{StoryId:int}/{*StorySlug}` (catch-all cosmetic slug).
- **Tests (2026-06-24):** Integration tier — `StoryDetailTests` (15 tests) covering new `StoryDetailsDTO`
  fields and `GetChapterListAsync` (ordering, alternates, content-rating ceiling, unpublished). RazorComponents
  tier — `ChapterListTests` (14), `StoryDesktopTests` (22), `StoryMobileTests` (21) = 57 tests. All green.
- **Tool:** Sonnet in Claude Code. **Pointer:** `audit/Stories.md` Feature 5.
  **Deps:** WU13, WU14, WU24, WU29, WU26.

### WU26 — Chapter reading + writing pages — DONE ✓ (2026-06-24)
*(Pattern 1 split; rating model reconciliation; reading-progress)*
- **Cells:** 6 L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5, 7 L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5, 44 L2/L3/L3.5 → Stage 5;
  Feature 6/7 L1+L2 rating reconciliation (ChapterContent.Rating → nullable, floor + primary invariants).
- **Architecture (settled WU26):** content-editing Pattern 1 — two separate routes:
  - **Reading page** `/story/{StoryId:int}/{ChapterNumber:int}[/{VersionOrder:int}]` — `RichTextView` +
    `ChapterNavigation` top+bottom + `CommentSection` + JS scroll-% tracking + reader settings cascade
    + `RecommendationHelpfulPrompt` gate. Public (content-rating filter applies).
    Author-only inline `@if` link to chapter edit page.
  - **Edit/write page** `/story/{id}/chapter/new` + `/story/{id}/chapter/{ch}/edit[/{versionOrder}/]`
    — `EditorView` + progressive-disclosure versioning UI. `[Authorize]` + ownership gate.
  - The two renderers (`RichTextView` / `EditorView`) never co-exist (different routes).
  - See `cross-cutting.md` "Chapter Versioning — Progressive Disclosure" for the full route table and
    rating-floor/primary invariants.
- **Phases:**
  - Phase 0: doc-touch (route docs, versioning rule, WU29 reconcile).
  - Phase 0.5: rating model reconciliation (nullable `ChapterContent.Rating`, migration, DTOs, read/write
    service floor + primary invariants).
  - Phase 1: Feature 44 `IReadingProgressWriteService` + `MarkStartedAsync` + rec prompt-gate read.
  - Phase 2: `ChapterReadingPage` dispatcher.
  - Phase 3: `ChapterEditorPage` + `ChapterPropertiesForm`.
- **Tool:** Sonnet in Claude Code (plan exists). **Pointer:** `audit/Chapters.md`.
  **Deps:** WU5, WU6, WU18, WU20, WU29.

### WU27 — Bookshelves page — DONE ✓ (2026-06-24)
- **Cells:** 17 L2/L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5.
- **Done:** Full `/bookshelves/{Tab?}` page (11 tabs). New service methods: `GetBookshelfStoryIdsAsync`,
  `GetStoryIdsByAuthorAsync` (content-rating bypass), `GetListingsAsync(filter, restrictToStoryIds?)`,
  `GetRecommendedStoryIdsAsync` + `GetHiddenGemStoryIdsAsync` (additive; own approved recs by active user).
  `BookshelfTabVisuals`, `BookshelvesPage` dispatcher, `BookshelvesDesktop`, `BookshelvesMobile`.
  Following reskinned teal site-wide (`#2DBBA0`).
  Tests: Unit (BookshelfTabVisualsTests, 14), Integration (BookshelfStoryIdsTests, 16),
  RazorComponents (BookshelvesDesktopTests 7 + BookshelvesMobileTests 10). All green.
  Human visual sign-off pending → Stage 6.
  **Pointer:** `audit/UserStoryInteractions.md` Feature 17. **Deps:** WU14, WU16, WU23.

### WU27.5 — Tag Directory + Tag Administration — DONE ✓ (2026-06-25)
- **Cells:** 34 L2/L3/L3.5 → Stage 5, 11 L2/L3/L3.5 → Stage 5. L4 both features stays Stage 1.
- **Done:** Phase 0: workplan split, audit repoints, cross-cutting.md role correction, forward_plan.md
  resolved. Phase 1: `DataSeeder.cs` assigns AdminUser to Moderator+Admin; `Tag.ChildTags` nav rename;
  composite `(TagName, TagTypeId)` index migration (`20260625032833_WU27_5_TagCompositeUniqueIndex`).
  Phase 2: `GetTagDirectoryAsync` + `TagDirectoryGroupDto`/`TagDirectoryNodeDto`; `TagChipDto` extended
  with `IsFanon`/`AllowOCDetails`/`ParentTagId`. Phase 3: `ITagWriteService`, `ServerTagWriteService`,
  `TagValidations`, `TagValidationException`, `CreateTagDto`/`UpdateTagDto`, `TagTypeLayout`,
  `TagEditorFormResult`; DI registered. Phase 4: `TagDirectoryPage` + `TagDirectoryDesktop` +
  `TagDirectoryMobile` + `TagDirectorySection` + `TagEditorForm`. Phase 5: 75 tests green (23 Unit,
  24 RazorComponents, 28 Integration). Detail in `audit/Tags.md` Feature 11 WU27.5 Stage note +
  `audit/Discovery.md` Feature 34 WU27.5 Stage note.
  **Tool:** Sonnet in Claude Code (plan approved 2026-06-24). **Pointer:** `audit/Tags.md` Feature 11,
  `audit/Discovery.md` Feature 34. **Deps:** WU4, WU9, WU11 (all Stage 5).

### WU28 — Discovery: Search Page + FTS consumption + §8.7 default-settings matrix DONE ✓ (2026-06-25)
- **Cells:** 31 L2 (random batch method); 31 L3.5 (page dispatcher + Desktop/Mobile composites);
  32 L2/L3-Logic/L3.5 (FTS consumed + verified via the page — already built in `GetListingsAsync`,
  WU28 exposes + confirms end-to-end). Also additive: `TagIncludeMode { And, Or }` enum
  (`Core/Discovery/`), `StoryFilterDto.IncludeMode`, `TagFilterSelection.IncludeMode`,
  `TagFilter.AllowIncludeModeToggle`, `ResultsFilterPanel.ShowTagIncludeModeToggle`/seed-chip params
  (extend already-Stage-5 components; no separate cell).
  **Feature 33 (Manual Tree Search) carved into WU40.**
- **Do:**
  - **Phase 0** (doc-touch first): workplan WU28 rewrite + WU40 add; `forward_plan.md` resolved items;
    `audit/Discovery.md` settled-vs-open; skill files `layer2-services.md` / `layer3.5-structure.md`.
  - **Phase 1a:** `GetRandomBatchAsync(StoryFilterDto filter, int batchSize)` — extract `ApplyFilters`
    private helper from `GetListingsAsync`; plain random draw from the post-filter set
    (`OrderBy(Random()).Take(batchSize)`), no shown-id tracking, no TotalCount; interface + impl +
    integration tests.
  - **Phase 1b:** `IDiscoveryDefaultsReadService.GetDefaultExcludedInteractionsAsync(string searchModeKey)`
    — system matrix overlaid with sparse per-user overrides; `HasStarted` key dropped from mapping;
    `ServerDiscoveryDefaultsReadService`; register in `Program.cs`; integration tests.
  - **Phase 1c:** `TagIncludeMode { And, Or }` enum; `StoryFilterDto.IncludeMode = And` (default preserves
    all existing behaviour); `ApplyFilters` Or branch (`Any(st => ids.Contains(st.TagId))`); integration tests.
  - **Phase 2a:** `TagFilterSelection.IncludeMode`; `TagFilter [Parameter] AllowIncludeModeToggle = false`
    + AND/OR control above include selectors only (exclude side unchanged); bUnit tests.
  - **Phase 2b:** `ResultsFilterPanel [Parameter] ShowTagIncludeModeToggle = false`; `[Parameter]
    IReadOnlyList<TagChipDto> InitialIncludedTags`/`InitialExcludedTags` (closes WU23-deferred seed-chip
    enrichment); bUnit tests.
  - **Phase 3a:** `SearchPage.razor` dispatcher (`SharedUI/Discovery/`, `@page "/discover"`,
    `[AllowAnonymous]`; §8.7 defaults seed on init; two modes: random-append + "Give me more" vs.
    sorted-offset pagination).
  - **Phase 3b:** `SearchDesktop.razor` / `SearchMobile.razor` composites (`ShowTagIncludeModeToggle=true`
    on panel; random mode suppresses pagination + shows Give-me-more button; sorted mode shows pagination).
  - **Phase 4:** tests — Integration: `DiscoveryDefaultsReadServiceTests`, `RandomBatchTests`,
    OR-include tag mode. RazorComponents: `SearchDesktopTests` / `SearchMobileTests`,
    `ResultsFilterPanelTests` (seed-chip + toggle), `TagFilterTests` (AND/OR control).
- **Cells flipped:** 31 L2 `2→5`; 32 L2/L3/L3.5 `2→5`. Feature 33 unchanged → WU40.
  Feature 31 L3.5 stays Stage 5 (additive page on already-Stage-5 cell, precedent WU13).
  L4 stays Stage 1 (visual sign-off pending, consistent with WU8/WU13/WU23 precedent).
- **Did:** All five phases complete. `SiteSearchModes`/`UserStoryInteractionFilters` moved to Core
  (SharedUI accessibility fix). `HttpStoryReadService` stub added for `GetRandomBatchAsync`.
  Pre-existing `IModerationWriteService` DI failures (37 RazorComponents tests across 4 classes)
  fixed by adding `FakeModerationWriteService` + registration. Final counts: 429 Unit (all pass);
  428 RazorComponents (all pass, 0 failures); 329 Integration pass (7 pre-existing
  `ModerationServiceTests` DI failures unrelated to WU28). New tests: `DiscoveryDefaultsReadServiceTests`
  (5 Integration), `RandomBatchTests` (7 Integration), `SearchDesktopTests` (8 RazorComponents),
  `SearchMobileTests` (9 RazorComponents). See `audit/Discovery.md` F31 WU28 Stage note.
- **Tool:** opusplan (plan approved 2026-06-25). **Pointer:** `audit/Discovery.md` Features 31, 32.
  **Deps:** WU14, WU23, WU4.

### WU29 — Recommendations ✓ DONE (2026-06-23/24)
- **Cells:** 27/28/29/30 L2/L3/L3.5/L4/L5 (L5 includes integration test isolation overhaul);
  27 L6 (unique index). F30 L5 stays at 2 (attribution trigger deferred to WU26).
- **Done:** submission, display (Author Spotlight ≤5, RecommendationLike), attribution surface minted
  (trigger deferred), RecommendationStatusEnum added to Core. Integration test isolation overhaul
  (Respawn + IntegrationTestBase + SeedUserAsync GUID-suffix fix) unlocked reliable L5 verification
  for F7/16/17/18/19/23/24/25/26/27/28/29/42/43. See `audit/Recommendations.md` + `testing.md`.
- **L4 visual sign-off:** completed 2026-06-23 (manual).
- **Pointer:** `audit/Recommendations.md`.

### WU30 — Profiles + Theme selection — DONE ✓ (2026-06-24)
- **Cells:** 20/21/22 L2/L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5; 3 L3/L3.5 → Stage 5. L4 visual sign-off pending (human
  run at `/settings` and `/user/{id}`) — Stage 6 gate = human visual approval.
- **Completed:** `IUserSettingsService` self-edit exception (`GetMySettingsAsync`, `UpdateProfileAsync`,
  `UpdateReaderSettingsAsync`, `UpdatePrivacySettingsAsync`, `UpdateAuthorSettingsAsync`,
  `UpdateAppearanceAsync`, `UploadProfilePictureAsync`). `IUserProfileReadService`
  (`GetProfileHeaderAsync(userId, includePrivate)`, `GetProfileTextAsync`). `IThemeReadService.GetThemesAsync`.
  Candidate-id queries: `GetFavoriteStoryIdsAsync` (on `IUserStoryInteractionReadService`),
  `GetRecommendedStoryIdsByUserAsync` (on `IRecommendationReadService`). `IBlogPostReadService.GetByAuthorAsync`
  extended with `includeUnpublished` flag; `IsPublished` added to `BlogPostListingDto`.
  `SettingsPage.razor` at `/settings` + 5 injection-free sub-form components (`ProfileSettingsForm`,
  `ReaderSettingsForm`, `PrivacySettingsForm`, `AuthorSettingsForm`, `AppearanceSettingsForm`).
  `ProfilePage.razor` at `/user/{UserId:int}/{*Tab}` (dispatcher — banner-once, tab-payload-on-switch;
  own-vs-other `includePrivate`; device-branch to `ProfileDesktop`/`ProfileMobile`).
  `ProfileBanner` (avatar, tagline, stats, vouches, relationship actions, Edit Profile link).
  `ProfileDesktop`/`ProfileMobile` (tab body — Profile tab = bio + `CommentSection` UserProfile context;
  story tabs = `StoryDeck` + `ResultsFilterPanel`; Blog tab = paginated `BlogPostCard` list).
  `UserStatsBlock` leaf. `BlogPostCard` de-nested (Edit link sibling of title anchor; `IsOwner`/`EditHref`
  params; draft badge). `CommentSection` generalized to 4th context (UserProfile) —
  `ProfileUserId` param, `UserProfile` case in all switches. UserStats real-time counter wiring across
  8 write services (`FollowerCount`/`AuthorsFollowed`, `StoriesWritten`, `WordsWritten` ± delta,
  `CommentsWritten` ±1, `RecommendationsWritten`/`RecommendationsReceived`, `BlogPostsWritten` ±1,
  `GroupsJoined` ±1, `FavoritesOnStories`/`StoriesRead`/`StoriesInProgress`/`StoriesIgnored` via
  transition-delta).
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green (1 pre-existing warning). `dotnet test`: 236 non-Group integration
  tests pass; 373 RazorComponents tests pass; 44 GroupServiceTests fail (all pre-existing WU32 issue —
  root cause at `CreateGroupAsync` line 47, unrelated to WU30 counter additions). Integration tests for
  WU30-specific paths (UserSettings round-trips, counter assertion, UserProfileComments) deferred to
  Phase 5. L4 visual sign-off pending (human).
- **Pointer:** `audit/Profiles.md`, `audit/Sprites.md` Feature 3 L3/L3.5. **Deps:** WU10, WU14, WU21, WU23.

### WU31 — Blog posts (profile only; Feature 56 deferred post-MVP) — DONE ✓ (2026-06-24)
- **Cells:** 35/36 L2/L3/L3.5 → Stage 5. L4 → Stage 1 (visual sign-off pending, same as WU13/WU24).
  Feature 56 stays Stage 2 (deferred post-MVP).
- **Completed:** Profile blog-post write + read (`ServerBlogPostReadService` / `ServerBlogPostWriteService`
  with two-query scalar split to work around EF Core 10 TPT + `IgnoreQueryFilters()` entity-materialization
  bug), likes, `CommentSection` generalized for blog-post context, `BlogPostPropertiesForm` +
  `BlogPostEditorPage` + `BlogPostPage` + `BlogPostCard`, content-rating filter on `BaseBlogPost`.
  `ExecuteDeleteAsync` on TPT base type replaced with raw SQL + CASCADE FK.
- **Verified:** `dotnet test` 691/691 green — Unit (205), Integration (215 incl. 20 BlogPostWriteServiceTests),
  RazorComponents (271 incl. 10 BlogPostPropertiesFormTests). L4 visual + server smoke still required.
- **Pointer:** `audit/BlogPosts.md`. **Deps:** WU6, WU20.

### WU31.5 — TPT denormalization retrofit (BlogPosts + Comments) — DONE ✓ (2026-06-24)
- **Cells:** F35/F36 L1/L2 + F23–F26 L1/L2 — momentarily reopened, returned to Stage 5 on green tests.
- **Completed:** (1) Discovery columns (`DateCreated`, `LastUpdatedDate`, `Rating`, `IsPublished`) moved
  from `BaseBlogPost` → `ProfileBlogPost`/`GroupBlogPost`. `DatePosted` moved from `BaseComment` →
  `ChapterComment`/`BlogPostComment`/`GroupComment`/`UserProfileComment`. (2) Named query filter
  removed from `BaseBlogPost`; content-rating ceiling checked via explicit `.Where(p => p.Rating <= max)`
  projection checks in `ServerBlogPostReadService`. (3) Two-query scalar split + raw-SQL delete
  removed; `GetByIdAsync`/`GetForEditAsync` now single projection on `ProfileBlogPosts`. Delete now
  uses change-tracker stub (`writeDb.Remove(new ProfileBlogPost { BlogPostId = id })`). (4) Migration
  `WU31_5_DenormalizeTptDiscoveryColumns` with manual data-copy SQL (base→child before drop).
  (5) Spec §4.3 denormalization technique corrected in `layer1-data-model.md`.
- **Verified:** `dotnet test` 691/691 green — Unit (205), Integration (215), RazorComponents (271).
  Content-rating projection path covered by existing `GetById_MaturePost_HiddenFromNonMatureViewer`,
  `GetById_MaturePost_VisibleToMatureViewer`, `GetById_MaturePost_VisibleToAuthorRegardlessOfMatureSetting`.
- **Pointer:** `audit/BlogPosts.md`, `audit/Comments.md`. **Deps:** WU31.

### WU31_5b — TPT phantom BaseComment FKs + integration-test DB wiring — DONE ✓ (2026-06-25)
- **Cells:** F23–F26 L1 (momentarily reopened, returned to Stage 5 on green tests);
  F38/39/40 L5 (2 → 5, unblocked by this fix).
- **Completed:**
  (1) Removed four phantom down-navigation properties from `BaseComment`
  (`BlogPostComment`, `ChapterComment`, `GroupComment`, `UserProfileComment`). These caused EF to
  produce backwards FK columns on `base_comments` (`{type}_comment_comment_id`), forming FK cycles
  that broke Respawn's topological sort and left `groups` rows alive between tests.
  Migration `WU31_5b_DropPhantomBaseCommentFKs` drops the 4 columns / 4 indexes / 4 FK constraints.
  Convention added to `canalave-conventions/layer1-data-model.md`.
  (2) Fixed `TestAppFactory` DB wiring: `ConfigureAppConfiguration` fires too late with
  `WebApplicationBuilder` — the connection string is read before the override lands. Rewrote to
  re-register both `DbContextOptions` in `ConfigureServices`. Documented in `testing.md`.
  (3) Fixed `ServerGroupWriteService.AddStoryAsync`: story lookup was missing
  `IgnoreQueryFilters(["ContentRating"])` — M-rated stories appeared not-found when `ShowMatureContent`
  was false, causing `AddStory_Tier2_…_Throws` to throw `KeyNotFoundException` instead of the
  expected `ContentRatingExceededException`.
  (4) Fixed `ServerRecommendationWriteService.SubmitAsync`: (a) `Select((int?)s.AuthorId)
  .FirstOrDefault()` confuses "story not found" with "story has null AuthorId" — fixed with
  anonymous-type projection; (b) unconditional `.Value` on nullable `storyAuthorId` crashes on
  authorless stories — fixed with `if (storyAuthorId.HasValue)`.
  (5) Fixed `GroupServiceTests.CreateGroup_Mature_PersistsCorrectRatingPair`: used `FindAsync`
  which applies the `GroupAudience` filter — Mature group returned null. Fixed with
  `IgnoreQueryFilters().FirstOrDefaultAsync(...)`.
- **Verified:** `dotnet test` → 298 integration / 414 unit / 397 RazorComponents = 1,109 total,
  all green.
- **Pointer:** `audit/Comments.md`, `audit/Groups.md`, `canalave-conventions/testing.md`. **Deps:** WU31.5.

### WU32 — Groups — DONE ✓ (2026-06-24)
- **Cells:** 38/39/40 L2/L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5.
- **Done:** Phase 0 doc-touch: settled rating model (AudienceRating vs MaxContentRating), GroupAudience
  named filter, membership/role model, group blog posts in scope, per-context comment pattern.
  Phase 1: `GroupRole`/`GroupAudienceType` enums, `GroupAudienceTypeMapper`, `Group.Rating → AudienceRating`
  rename, `DbSet<GroupComment>`, `GroupAudience` named filter, migration `WU32_Groups`.
  Phase 2: Full L2 services (Core contracts + Server impls + DI) — group CRUD, join/leave, rating
  waterfall, folder CRUD, group comments, group blog posts, notification fan-out.
  Phase 3: `GroupCard`, `GroupsPage`, `GroupPage` (dispatcher), `GroupDesktop`, `GroupMobile`,
  `GroupCreateEditPage`, `GroupBlogPostEditorPage`. `CommentSection.GroupId` + `CommentTarget.Group`.
  Phase 4: Unit (`GroupAudienceTypeMapperTests`, `GroupValidationsTests` — 22 tests),
  Integration (`GroupServiceTests` — 22 tests, DB-gated), RazorComponents (`GroupCardTests`,
  `CommentSectionGroupTests` — 15 tests).
  `dotnet build` green (0 errors); 513 non-integration tests pass (227 unit + 286 RazorComponents).
  **Pointer:** `audit/Groups.md`. **Deps:** WU14, WU6, WU20.

### WU33 — Notifications UI — DONE ✓ (2026-06-24)
- **Cells:** 42 L3/L3.5 → Stage 5, 43 L3/L3.5 → Stage 5. L4 stays Stage 1 (pending visual sign-off
  per WU8/WU13/WU23 precedent — Tailwind classes are present but not locked into Pattern Accumulation).
  F42 L2 additive enrichment (SourceUserName, TargetTitle, TargetUrl, GetTotalCountAsync) also verified.
- **Done:** Phase 0 doc-touch (layer2/layer3.5/layer4/cross-cutting skills + audit + forward_plan);
  Phase 1 L2 enrichment (NotificationFeedOrder enum, NotificationDto extended, INotificationReadService
  updated, ServerNotificationReadService two-pass batch enrichment); Phase 2 presentation atoms
  (NotificationCategoryVisuals.cs, NotificationPresenter.cs, NotificationItem.razor); Phase 3
  NotificationsPage.razor (by-date + by-category views, view toggle, sort toggle, mark-all, pagination);
  Phase 4 NotificationBell.razor + layout insertion (DesktopLayout + MobileLayout); Phase 5
  NotificationSettingsPage.razor (per-row immediate save, grouped by category); Phase 6 tests
  (Integration: 6 new WU33 tests — enrichment, total-count, ordering; Unit: 22+13 new tests in
  NotificationCategoryVisualsTests + NotificationPresenterTests; RazorComponents: pre-existing 308
  unchanged — notification RazorComponents tests deferred per plan's note on FakeNotificationWriteService).
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` 0 errors; `dotnet test` — Unit 391 ✓, RazorComponents 308 ✓, Integration
  notification tests 22/22 ✓ (GroupServiceTests failures are pre-existing, unrelated). Routes auto-
  discovered from SharedUI assembly — `/notifications` and `/notifications/settings` wired. Visual
  sign-off pending (bell flyout, page view toggle, settings toggles).
- **Pointer:** `audit/Notifications.md`. **Deps:** WU22.

### WU34 — Moderation (reporting, queue, actions, approval workflow, related notifications) DONE ✓ (2026-06-25)
- **Cells:** 46 L2/L3-Logic/L3.5/L4; 47 L2/L3-Logic/L3.5/L4; 48 L2/L3/L3.5/L4.
  Momentary L1 reopen (→ Stage 5 on green, precedent WU31.5): `Report.ReportedEntityId int→long`;
  `ReportedEntityType` +`Message`; soft-delete columns on Story/BaseComment/BaseBlogPost/Recommendation
  (`IsHidden`, `DateModeratedRemoved`, `ModerationRemovalReason`); `User.AccountStatus` +
  `SuspendedUntilUtc` + `ActiveReportCount`; `NotificationType` seed for `StoryApproved` (type 75).
  Notification semantic methods are additive to Features 41/42 (no stage change on those cells).
- **Settled decisions (do not revisit in opusplan):**
  1. **Soft-delete default, narrow hard-delete escape hatch.** Normal mod action = `IsHidden = true`
     (reversible, author notified with reason). Separate explicit "illegal content" path hard-deletes
     (CSAM/piracy only). Rationale: archive mission — mistakes must be reversible; authors are owed the
     reason. This is the opposite default from attention platforms. See `cross-cutting.md` "Moderation Model."
  2. **No auto-hide.** `ActiveReportCount` drives mod-only queue ordering (most-reported first) and
     an inline badge — never an automatic action. Deliberations' "3 distinct reporters in 24h" threshold
     is dropped. Report counts are mod-only (no public display — that gamifies reporting and enables
     brigading). See `cross-cutting.md` "Moderation Model."
  3. **Account actions: model state + notify now; login enforcement staged.** `AccountStatus` enum
     (Active/Warned/Suspended/Banned — no Shadowbanned) + `SuspendedUntilUtc` on `User`. Actions set
     status, record on `Report`, and notify. Login-blocking enforcement is a follow-up slice (see
     deferred-follow-up note below). **Shadowban rejected permanently** — deception-as-moderation,
     contradicts §13 transparency philosophy.
  4. **`User.ActiveReportCount` added** (symmetric with other authored-content targets; uniform
     `AdjustActiveReportCount(type, id, delta)` switch; skips `PrivateMessage`).
  5. **Reportable targets widen to `long`.** Set = Story, User, Comment, BlogPost, Recommendation,
     PrivateMessage. `ReportedEntityType` +`Message = 5`.
  6. **Notification dedup-key fix.** `CreateCoreAsync` currently dedups on `(type, sourceUserId, !IsRead)`;
     widen key to include `RelatedEntityId`. Regression-test follow/vouch/group notification suites.
  7. **`StoryApproved` notification type added** (`NotificationTypeEnum.StoryApproved = 75`,
     category `YourStories=2`, `KindFor → Story`). Seeded `NotificationType` row + migration.
  8. **`/mod/submissions` tabbed shell; rec-approval wiring deferred.** Recs currently write as
     `Approved` directly. Build the tab shell; import-verification tab drops in with WU39. Do not change
     the rec write-path in WU34.
- **Superseded (from `Moderation_And_Reporting_Deliberations.md` — do not resurrect):**
  `RequestedStatusId` (use `StoryDetail.PostApprovalStatus`); `Author` role (SiteRoles =
  User/Moderator/Admin); single `IModerationService` (CQRS-lite split); Shadowban; 3-reporter
  auto-hide; SQL trigger on `FavoriteCount`; `DefaultCommentModeration`/`AllowGuestComments` in
  `AuthorSettings`; single "Moderation & Safety" notification category (live: Warnings=7, YourReports=8).
- **Build phases (for opusplan):**
  - Phase 0 — Doc-touch: `forward_plan.md` + `cross-cutting.md` + `layer2-services.md` + audit files.
  - Phase 1 — Cluster relocation + schema: move `Report`/`ReportReason`/`ReportStatus` → `Core/Moderation/`
    (StoryImport stays in `Core/Models/` for WU39). One migration: widen `ReportedEntityId`; add soft-delete
    columns; add `User` columns; add `Report(ReportStatusId)` + `Report(ReportedEntityType, ReportedEntityId)`
    indexes; seed `StoryApproved` `NotificationType`. Add `"ModeratedVisibility"` named query filters on
    four content entities; mod/author reads use `IgnoreQueryFilters`.
  - Phase 2 — Notifications: dedup-key fix in `CreateCoreAsync`; add semantic methods
    (`NotifyReportReceivedAsync`, `NotifyReportResolvedAsync`, `NotifyReportResolvedNoActionAsync`,
    `NotifyContentRemovedAsync`, `NotifyStoryRejectedAsync`, `NotifyStoryApprovedAsync`,
    `NotifyAccountWarningAsync`/`Suspended`/`Banned`); `KindFor` branch for `StoryApproved → Story`.
  - Phase 3 — Moderation services: `Core/Moderation/` DTOs (`SubmitReportRequest`, `ReportReasonDto`,
    `ReportQueueItemDto`, `ModeratedTargetDto`) + `IModerationReadService`/`IModerationWriteService`;
    `Server/Moderation/ServerModerationReadService` + `ServerModerationWriteService`. DI in `Program.cs`.
  - Phase 4 — `ReportDialog` + entry points: reusable `ReportDialog.razor` (reuses `ConfirmDialog` pattern,
    WU9); add report affordances on StoryCard, UserCard, CommentItem, BlogPostCard, recommendation cards,
    message thread. 46 L5 stays Stage 2 (public, can be WASM later).
  - Phase 5 — `/mod/reports` queue: `@page "/mod/reports"`, `[Authorize(Policy="RequireModerator")]`,
    two-pass `BatchLoadEntitiesAsync` pattern for polymorphic target label + deep-link, ordered by
    `ActiveReportCount` desc.
  - Phase 6 — Moderator actions: resolve-no-action / resolve-action-taken / claim logic; content
    removal `ApplyRemoval(type, id, reason)` switch (soft-hide default; explicit hard-delete variant);
    account actions set `AccountStatus`/`SuspendedUntilUtc` + notify (no login enforcement yet).
  - Phase 7 — `/mod/submissions` + `/mod/users`: submissions tabbed shell; approve → `StoryStatusId =
    PostApprovalStatus` + `NotifyStoryApprovedAsync`; reject → `Rejected` + reason + `NotifyStoryRejectedAsync`.
    Users: lookup + report history + warn/suspend/ban controls. Both server-rendered, mod-gated.
  - Phase 8 — Tests: Unit (target-type allow-set, `AdjustActiveReportCount` switch, dedup-key fix);
    Integration (submit increments + ReportReceived; resolve decrements + notifies; dedup-key regression;
    approve/reject; soft-hide visibility filter; non-mod → 403); bUnit (ReportDialog, ModReportsPage,
    submissions tab shell).
- **Ordering:** 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 5 → 7 → 8 (woven).
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Moderation.md` Features 46/47/48; `cross-cutting.md` "Moderation
  Model." **Deps:** WU9, WU12, WU20, WU22, WU24, WU29, WU31, WU35.

### WU35 — Messaging — DONE ✓ (2026-06-24)
- **Cells:** 49 L2/L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5.
- **Do:** `/messages/{ConversationId?}`, three-table model, SignalR realtime (InteractiveServer), EditorView
  composition, `LastReadTimestamp`, `AllowPrivateMessages` gate. **Tool:** opusplan.
  **Pointer:** `audit/Messaging.md`. **Deps:** WU6.

### WU36 — Badges — DONE ✓ (2026-06-25)
- **Cells:** 50 L2→5 / L3→5 / L3.5→5 (L4 stays 1 — visual sign-off pending; L1 was already 5).
- **Did:** `IBadgeReadService` / `IBadgeWriteService` + `EarnedBadgeDto`; `ServerBadgeReadService` /
  `ServerBadgeWriteService`; DI registration; `UserStat.RecommendationSuccessesEarned` column +
  `SiteBadges.RecommenderSilver` seed (migration `20260625234308_WU36_Badges`); award trigger wired
  in `ServerRecommendationWriteService.RecordSuccessAsync` (anti-self-farm, best-effort, idempotent);
  display-projection fix at all 6 card-producer sites; `BadgeSettingsForm.razor` + `SettingsPage.razor`
  wiring. Tests: `BadgeServiceTests` (11 Integration) + 6 Tastemaker award-chain tests in
  `RecommendationWriteServiceTests` + `BadgeSettingsFormTests` (14 RazorComponents). All WU36
  tests green; pre-existing `ModerationServiceTests` DI failures (7) unrelated to this WU.
  **Pointer:** `audit/Badges.md`. **Deps:** WU30.

### WU37 — Story Tagging — structured authoring (Feature 12)
- **Cells:** 12 L2/L3/L3.5 → Stage 5 (L4 → Stage 1, visual sign-off pending). L1 additions
  (`AllowSettingDetails`, `StoryCharacterPairing` rename, `UNIQUE(SettingDetail)`, new
  `StoryCharacterPairingMember`) noted against the existing Stage-5 L1 cell.
- **Scope note (2026-06-25):** Features 9 (Series), 10 (story↔story Relationships), 15 (Saved Tag
  Selections) were originally bundled here; carved to WU41/WU42/WU43 — each is independently
  L1-settled, greenfield from L2, with no design coupling to Feature 12.
- **Architecture:** shared catalog / differentiated per-story association.
  - Genre/ContentWarning/CrossoverFandom → `StoryTag` (flat)
  - Setting → `StoryTag` + optional `SettingDetail` side-row
  - Character → `StoryCharacter` (replaces `StoryTag`; OC payload + pairing anchor)
  - Pairing (ship) → `StoryCharacterPairing` + `StoryCharacterPairingMember` join (renamed from
    `StoryCharacterRelationship`; promotes the only implicit shadow join to first-class entity)
  - `TagTypeEnum.Relationship` removed; a pairing is not a catalog tag.
  - `ApplyFilters` partitions included/excluded ids by `TagTypeId`: Character ids →
    `s.StoryCharacters.Any(...)`, all others → `s.StoryTags.Any(...)`.
    (See `audit/Discovery.md` Feature 31.)
- **DONE ✓ (2026-06-25):** Phase 0 doc-touch → Phase 1 L1 migration (`WU37_StructuredStoryTagging`)
  → Phase 2 L2 write/read + `ApplyFilters` character branch → Phase 3 L3/L3.5 `StoryPropertiesForm`
  rebuild (`CharacterEntry`, `SettingEntry`, `PairingBuilder`) + `StoryEditorPage` mapping
  → Phase 5 integration tests (`StoryTaggingTests.cs`, 12 tests) + RazorComponents tests
  (`CharacterEntryTests.cs` 8 tests, `PairingBuilderTests.cs` 5 tests) → Phase 6 view-page display
  (`StoryDetailsDTO` extended, `GetStoryByIdAsync` projection, `StoryDesktop`/`StoryMobile` OC names
  + ship pills). L4 stays Stage 1 pending human visual sign-off.
  Final: 348 Integration + 440 RazorComponents + 434 Unit = **1222 tests green**.
- **Enforcement:** service-layer only (`CanSave()` / `StoryValidationException`); no DB trigger.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Tags.md` Feature 12; `audit/Discovery.md` Feature 31
  (ApplyFilters branch). **Deps:** WU11, WU24, WU27.5.

### WU37.5 — Pre-Integration Cleanup — DONE ✓ (2026-06-26)
- **Cells:** All touched cells were already Stage 5; this is a code-quality / naming cleanup, not a
  stage change. Cells that were re-verified clean: F3 L2 (Sprites), F12 L1/L2 (Tags/Lookups enum),
  F46/F47/F48 L2/L3-Logic/L3.5 (Moderation). No stage number changes to `status.md`.
- **Done (5 phases):**
  - **Phase 0 doc prep:** `forward_plan.md` "Decisions that need you" row added for deferred
    non-story rating-route scoping (blog posts, recs, rated comments).
  - **Phase 1 enum cleanup:** Deleted vestigial `CharacterRelationshipType { Romantic, Platonic }`
    enum (zero references; live type is `CharacterPairingType`). Changed `CharacterPairingType : byte`
    → `: short` (convention alignment; no migration — Npgsql maps both to `smallint`). Removed dead
    placeholder comment in `ModelEnums.cs`.
  - **Phase 2 moderation:** Renamed soft-delete columns on Story/BaseComment/BaseBlogPost/Recommendation:
    `IsHidden → IsTakenDown`, `DateModeratedRemoved → TakedownDate`, `ModerationRemovalReason →
    TakedownReason`. Added `IModeratableContent` interface (`Core/Moderation/`) implemented by all four
    roots. Collapsed three-switch dispatch in `ServerModerationWriteService` → single `LoadModeratableAsync`
    loader + interface mutation. Renamed EF named filter key `"ModeratedVisibility" → "IsTakenDown"`.
    Replaced all parameterless `IgnoreQueryFilters()` in moderation services with by-name
    `IgnoreQueryFilters(["IsTakenDown"])` so `ContentRating`/`GroupAudience` stay live — a moderator's
    rating reach equals their `ShowMatureContent`. Report-queue stitch drops rows filtered by `ContentRating`
    instead of emitting `[Type #Id]` placeholder. Removed no-op `IgnoreQueryFilters()` on `ReadDb.Reports`.
    Updated all call sites in `ModerationServiceTests`, `GroupServiceTests`, `BlogPostWriteServiceTests`.
    EF migrations: `PreIntegrationCleanup_TakedownColumns` (ApplicationDbContext + ReadOnlyApplicationDbContext).
  - **Phase 3 sprites:** `ServerSpriteReadService` rewritten as singleton with startup existence cache
    (enumerates `wwwroot/sprites/themes/*/{animated,static}/` into HashSets at construction; O(1) lookups,
    no `File.Exists` per call). DI changed `AddScoped → AddSingleton`. `SpriteReadServiceExtensions.cs`
    added (`GetSpriteUrl(ISpriteReadService, IActiveUserContext, string)` extension). Five call sites
    updated in `ServerStoryReadService` and `ServerTagReadService`. Unit tests restructured so
    `BuildSut()` is called after `CreateSpriteFile()` (startup cache requires files to exist at construction).
  - **Phase 4 home placeholder:** Replaced `HomeDesktop.razor` WU13 harness (hardcoded StoryCard sample
    data) and `HomeMobile.razor` stub with honest minimal placeholders. `<DevLoginBar />` retained.
  - **Phase 5 docs:** `cross-cutting.md`, `layer2-services.md`, `layer1-data-model.md` enum table,
    `audit/Moderation.md`, `audit/Sprites.md`, `audit/Tags.md` all updated. `forward_plan.md`
    "Decisions that need you" row added.
- **Migrations:** `PreIntegrationCleanup_TakedownColumns` (column renames on 4 tables);
  `PreIntegrationCleanup_PairingTypeShort` (empty — snapshot sync for `CharacterPairingType` type change).
  Both ApplicationDbContext + ReadOnlyApplicationDbContext.
- **Verified (2026-06-26):** `dotnet build` 0 errors; `dotnet test` 434 Unit + 440 RazorComponents +
  348 Integration = **1222 tests green**.
- **Tool:** Opus (holistic pre-integration audit + implementation). **Pointer:** `audit/Moderation.md`
  Features 46/47/48; `audit/Sprites.md` Feature 3 L2; `audit/Tags.md` Shared Context.

### WU38 — Sprite System Redesign + Existence Validation — DONE ✓ (2026-06-27)
- **Cells:** 3 L5 → Stage 5 (resolved Stage-4 divergence; prior: Server startup-scan cache vs. Client
  optimistic build; now: single `OptimisticSpriteReadService` in Core, registered on both). All other
  touched cells (3 L1/L2/L3.5, 11 L2/L3, 4 L2, 20 L2) were already Stage 5 — corrections within
  Stage 5, no regression.
- **Done (9 phases):**
  - **Phase 0 (doc prep, moment 1):** Skill files updated — `layer2-services.md` (sprite resolution
    moves to render time; `ISpriteReadService` allowed in SharedUI; `ISpriteAssetProbe` server-only),
    `cross-cutting.md` (ThemeContext cascading provider + SpriteBaseUrl seam),
    `layer1-data-model.md` (`Theme.Slug` convention). Audit files (`Sprites.md`, `Tags.md`,
    `Stories.md`, `ImageStorage.md`) updated with settled decisions. `forward_plan.md` moved sprite
    redesign to Resolved.
  - **Phase 1:** `Theme.Slug` column added (`[Required][MaxLength(64)]`, unique index). Migration
    `WU38_ThemeSlug` on both DbContexts; seed updated `{ Name="Pokémon", Slug="pokemon" }`.
  - **Phase 2:** Claims carry slug — `ApplicationUserClaimsPrincipalFactory` bakes `Theme.Slug`
    (not `.Name`) into the `canalave:theme` claim; default changed `"Pokémon"` → `"pokemon"` in
    `ServerActiveUserContext`, `ApplicationDbContextFactory`, and `IActiveUserContext` XML doc.
  - **Phase 3:** `OptimisticSpriteReadService` (Core/Sprites/) — pure string builder, singleton on
    both Server and Client. `SpriteBaseUrl` config seam (`Sprites:BaseUrl`, default
    `/sprites/themes`). Deleted `ServerSpriteReadService`, `SpriteReadServiceExtensions`, and
    `Client/OptimisticSpriteService`.
  - **Phase 4:** `ThemeContext(string Slug, bool PrefersAnimated)` record (Core/Sprites/).
    `ThemeContextProvider.razor` (Server) reads claims from cascaded `AuthenticationState`;
    nested inside `CascadingAuthenticationState` in `Routes.razor`.
  - **Phase 5:** `TagChipDto.SpriteUrl` renamed → `SpriteIdentifier`. `ServerTagReadService` and
    `ServerStoryReadService` drop `ISpriteReadService` dep; project raw `SpriteIdentifier`.
    `TagChip`, `TagSelector`, `CharacterEntry` inject `ISpriteReadService` + take `[CascadingParameter]
    ThemeContext`; resolve URL at render time with `onerror` fallback chain. `sprite-fallback.js`
    helper (SharedUI wwwroot); script tag added to `App.razor`.
  - **Phase 6:** `ISpriteAssetProbe` (Core) + `LocalSpriteAssetProbe` (Server, `File.Exists`
    against static PNG). `TagSaveResult(int TagId, string? SpriteWarning)` record. `ITagWriteService`
    signatures updated. `ServerTagWriteService` probes default theme; surfaces non-blocking warning.
    `TagDirectoryPage` shows amber advisory.
  - **Phase 7:** `IImageStorageService.DeleteAsync` callers added: `ServerStoryWriteService.UpdateStoryAsync`
    (best-effort cover cleanup) + `ServerUserSettingsService.UploadProfilePictureAsync` (best-effort
    avatar cleanup).
  - **Phase 8:** `wwwroot/sprites/themes/pokemon/unknown.png` (1×1 transparent PNG fallback).
    `.gitignore` updated — `static/` and `animated/` subdirs gitignored; `unknown.png` at theme root
    committed so the fallback renders correctly without provisioning a full pack.
- **Test backfill (all tiers):**
  - Unit — `SpriteReadServiceTests` rewritten for `OptimisticSpriteReadService` (5 tests);
    `LocalSpriteAssetProbeTests` new (4 tests).
  - RazorComponents — `TagChipTests` rewritten for new architecture (11 tests, `AddCascadingValue`
    + `ISpriteReadService` registration). All RazorComponents test contexts that render
    `TagChip`/`TagSelector`/`CharacterEntry` updated to register `ISpriteReadService`.
  - Integration — `TagWriteServiceTests` unwraps `TagSaveResult.TagId` at all call sites;
    `TagReadServiceTests` uses `SpriteIdentifier` (not `SpriteUrl`).
- **Verified (2026-06-27):** `dotnet build` 0 errors; `dotnet test` 437 Unit + 443 RazorComponents +
  348 Integration = **1228 tests green**.
- **Tool:** Opus (multi-phase holistic redesign). **Pointer:** `audit/Sprites.md` Feature 3,
  `audit/Tags.md` Feature 11 WU38 note, `audit/ImageStorage.md` WU38 note.
- **Deps:** WU27.5.

### WU38a — Account Deletion UI
- **Cells:** 52 L3/L3.5 (deletion UI; service already in WU1).
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Identity.md`. **Deps:** WU25.

### WU38b — View Count
- **Cells:** 45 L2/L3 (view-count MVP direct increment, first client ping).
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Stories.md` Feature 45. **Deps:** WU25.

### WU38c — Export (epub/pdf)
- **Cells:** 54 L2 (epub/pdf export, app-layer only).
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Export.md`. **Deps:** WU25.

### WU40 — Manual Tree Search (Feature 33)
- **Cells:** 33 L2 / L3-Logic / L3.5 → Stage 5.
- **Direction settled (WU28 Phase 0, 2026-06-25):** stateless pivot over live tables (not the mart —
  the mart is post-MVP). Four clean edges: authored-by, public-favorite, recommendation, hidden-gem.
  Distinct graph/node visualization — **NOT `StoryDeck`**. Stateless fresh search each pivot (no
  shown-id tracking); privacy model: graph never reveals identity (§5.4); hidden-gem edge requires
  `allow_discovery_consent`-opted authors. Corroborated by original deliberations' §2 stateless-fresh-
  search and §3 hidden-gem chain-of-trust. See `audit/Discovery.md` Feature 33.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Discovery.md` Feature 33. **Deps:** WU14, WU23, WU4, WU25.

### WU39 — Story Import & Verification
- **Cells:** 53 L2/L3/L3.5/L4.
- **Do:** author-facing import submission (re-posting an externally-published own work — not a scraper):
  supply `SourcePlatform`/`SourceUrl` + `OriginalPublishedDate`/`OriginalLastUpdatedDate`, create the
  `StoryImport` row (unique `StoryId` + unique `SourceUrl`), route the story into `PendingApproval`.
  Extend the WU34 `/mod/submissions` tabbed shell with an **import-verification** tab: moderator confirms
  the account holder is the original author (MVP = manual review of the two-way link / `SourceUrl`;
  `StoryImport.VerificationStatus` records the outcome). Relocate `StoryImport` → `Core/Moderation/`
  (or `Core/Stories/`) at this point.
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Moderation.md` Feature 53. **Deps:** WU24, WU34.

> **Deferred follow-up (not yet sequenced):** Account-status login enforcement — block Suspended (until
> `SuspendedUntilUtc`) / Banned users at login and surface the Warned banner in layout chrome. WU34 ships
> the `AccountStatus` state + notifications it builds on; enforcement is a security-surface slice to append
> as its own WU when scheduled (candidate: alongside WU38 account-deletion UI). No stage number yet.

### WU41 — Series (Feature 9)
- **Cells:** 9 L2/L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5 (L4 pending visual sign-off).
- **Do:** `ISeriesReadService` / `ISeriesWriteService`; `SeriesEntry` ordered membership (position
  field); series creation/edit/delete (author-gated); series browse page + `StoryDeck`; series
  membership display on `StoryPage`. L1 already Stage 5 (`Series`, `SeriesEntry` present).
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Stories.md` Feature 9. **Deps:** WU14, WU24.

### WU42 — Story↔Story Relationships (Feature 10)
- **Cells:** 10 L2/L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5 (L4 pending visual sign-off).
- **Do:** `IStoryRelationshipReadService` / `IStoryRelationshipWriteService`; create/accept/reject
  flow on `StoryRelationship` (`SourceStoryId`, `TargetStoryId`, `RelationshipTypeId`, `StatusId`);
  related-stories display on `StoryPage`. L1 already Stage 5 (`StoryRelationship`,
  `StoryRelationshipType` present — unrelated to the `StoryCharacterPairing` introduced in WU37).
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Stories.md` Feature 10. **Deps:** WU24, WU25.

### WU43 — Saved Tag Selections (Feature 15)
- **Cells:** 15 L2/L3/L3.5/L4 → Stage 5 (L4 pending visual sign-off).
- **Do:** `ISavedTagSelectionReadService` / `ISavedTagSelectionWriteService`; save/load/delete/share
  (copy-on-write on public share) of tag filter sets; UI in `ResultsFilterPanel` (load dropdown +
  save-as affordance). L1 already Stage 5 (`SavedTagSelection`, `SavedTagSelectionEntry` present with
  unique constraints).
- **Tool:** opusplan. **Pointer:** `audit/Tags.md` Feature 15. **Deps:** WU23, WU27.5.

### WU-FilterRevamp — Content-visibility filter revamp + two dead-code removals DONE ✓ (2026-06-27)
- **Cells changed:** F4/F5 L5 `4 → 2`. All other affected cells (Moderation/Groups/Recommendations/
  BlogPosts L2) were already Stage 5 and remain so — this work corrected the code underlying them.
- **Done:**
  - **Phase A:** All four named EF display/visibility filters (`ContentRating`, `GroupAudience`,
    `IsTakenDown` ×4 roots) moved from `ApplicationDbContext.OnModelCreating` to
    `ReadOnlyApplicationDbContext.OnModelCreating`. `_activeUser` changed from `private` to
    `protected`. Write context sees ground truth with no filters. ~15 write-side `IgnoreQueryFilters`
    calls deleted; ~7 read-side elevated reads kept and annotated `// elevated read:`. Latent edit
    bug at `ServerStoryWriteService:51` fixed by construction.
  - **B1:** `Migrations/ReadOnlyApplicationDb/` deleted (9 files). Read context owns no migration
    history; `ApplicationDbContext` is the sole migration source.
  - **B2:** `HttpStoryReadService.cs` + `HttpStoryWriteService.cs` deleted; DI registrations at
    `Client/Program.cs:16-17` removed; stale doc comment in `StoryDetailsDTO.cs:42` updated.
  - **Tests:** `ContentRatingFilterTests` extended (+5 integration tests incl. line-51 regression);
    `ModerationServiceTests` fixture corrected. All 1232 tests pass.
  - **Docs:** `cross-cutting.md`, `layer1-data-model.md`, `layer2-services.md` skill files updated;
    `audit/Stories.md` and `audit/Moderation.md` Stage notes written; `status.md` updated.
- **Pointer:** `audit/Stories.md` §"Feature 4 / Feature 5 — Filter revamp Stage note."

### WU-CounterAtomicity — Denormalized-counter lost-update fix + CS9107 tidy — DONE ✓ (2026-06-27)
- **Cells changed:** none — Comments L2/L3 and Recommendations L2/L3 stay Stage 5; Stories L2/L3
  stay Stage 5. These were correctness polishes inside already-aligned cells; no stage transition.
- **Done:**
  - `ServerRecommendationWriteService.ToggleLikeAsync` and `ServerCommentWriteService.ToggleLikeAsync`:
    replaced tracked read-modify-write (`rec.LikeCount++`) with atomic
    `ExecuteUpdateAsync(SetProperty(x => x.LikeCount, x => x.LikeCount + delta))` after the join-row
    `SaveChangesAsync`. Returned DTO value unchanged (optimistic `loaded + delta`). Eliminates the
    lost-update race when two users like the same target concurrently.
  - `ServerStoryReadService`: promoted `activeUser` primary-ctor parameter to
    `protected IActiveUserContext ActiveUser { get; } = activeUser;` (same pattern as
    `ServerBlogPostReadService`); routed internal uses through `ActiveUser`.
  - `ServerStoryWriteService`: changed two `activeUser.UserId` references to `ActiveUser.UserId`
    (via the inherited property). The ctor parameter now only appears in the base-ctor argument, not
    as a captured field — CS9107 eliminated.
  - `cross-cutting.md` §"UserStats Updates": added "Counter mutation rule" subsection documenting
    the atomic `ExecuteUpdateAsync` requirement for all denormalized counters.
- **Verified:** `dotnet build` green, zero errors, zero CS9107 warnings. `dotnet test` 1232/1232 pass
  (437 Unit + 443 RazorComponents + 352 Integration). Concurrency fix is not automatable
  (no parallel-request seam in the test harness); covered by code review + sequential toggle tests
  confirming correct counter behavior.
- **Pointer:** `audit/Recommendations.md` §Feature 29, `audit/Comments.md` §Feature 25,
  `audit/Stories.md` §"WU-CounterAtomicity Stage note."

## Blocked / deferred — genuine Stage-1 intent gaps (no sequence number)

These have an undesigned UI; resolve the design (chat with skill files) before they can be sequenced.
Their non-UI layers (L1/L2) may already be Stage 5/2 but the *UI cells* are blocked.

- **Story Arcs UI** (8 L3/L3.5) — §8.2 arc-management UI never designed. (L1 Stage 5, L2 Stage 2.)
- **Polls UI** (37 L3/L3.5) — §8.6 detailed poll UI unspecified.
- **Custom Lists** (51 L3/L3.5) — §8.7 creation flow + filter composition TBD.
- **Community Spotlight** (55, all layers) — §5.26 donation infra TBD; entity is a placeholder.

When a gap resolves: it becomes Stage 2 (or 3 if the conversation yields a build-ready spec); insert a
work-unit into Phase 3 and update `status.md` + the audit file.

## Post-MVP — Layers 5–8 (additive, batchable; not sequenced here)

Per `grid_axes.md` §"The Two Boundaries": these swap method bodies / add DDL / add standalone workers
behind the contracts frozen in Layers 1–4. Batch by pattern when the MVP slice they sit behind is stable.

- **Messaging realtime push (SignalR).** Post-MVP additive layer on top of the stateless WU35 write
  service (settled WU35, 2026-06-24 — see `forward_plan.md` Resolved, `cross-cutting.md` "Private
  Messaging Architecture"). Build: first app-level `Hub` class (`MessagesHub`), `AddSignalR()` in
  `Program.cs`, `MapHub<MessagesHub>("/hubs/messages")`; per-conversation SignalR group join/leave on
  thread open; broadcast via `IHubContext<MessagesHub>` alongside `SendMessageAsync` in the write
  service; client-side receive handler calling `InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged)`. No changes to L1–L4 —
  the write service's sanitize+persist+return-DTO path is unchanged. Hub integration test harness
  needed (no existing template). Feature 49 L5 stays N/A (this is not a REST-endpoint pattern).
- **L5 — WASM enablement (all features).** Map endpoints from the stable `IXService` contracts + `Client`
  HTTP impls. Includes the two genuine mechanical Stage-4 cells — **Story L5 endpoint wiring** (4/5 L5:
  `HttpStory*Service` call `/{id}/edit` + write routes `StoryEndpoints` never maps) and **Sprites L5**
  (`WasmSpriteReadService` optimistic URLs, 3 L5 Stage 4). Pointers: `audit/Stories.md` §3a,
  `audit/Sprites.md`. Governed by `layer5-wasm.md`.
- **L6 — SQL indexes (batch DDL).** Regenerate UserStoryInteraction filtered indexes off the re-modeled
  `has_started` columns (16/17 L6 Stage 4), comment golden index `(chapter_id, date_posted DESC)`, StoryTag
  reverse index, etc. FTS GIN on `StoryListing.SearchVector` already in `InitialSchema`. Pointers:
  per-folder audit L6 notes. Governed by `layer6-indexes.md`.
- **L7 — Redis integration.** Write-behind (16/17 interactions, 45 view counts via `INCR`), ephemeral
  store (44 LastReadDate hash), read-side cache (61 top-100). MVP direct-write bodies get swapped behind
  unchanged signatures. Governed by `layer7-redis.md`.
- **L8 — Data marts (+ horizontal boundary: requires real user data).** 59 Automatic Tree Search, 60 Tree
  Search Data Mart Worker, 61 Also Favorited / Also Recommended, 62 SiteDailyStat Worker. No EF model —
  raw-SQL tables, zero-downtime swap (resolved: `SiteDailyStat`/marts have no EF model). Pointers:
  `audit/Discovery.md` L8 notes, `audit/Moderation.md` Feature 62. Governed by `layer8-data-marts.md`.
- **Deferred workers (nothing to operate on yet — `grid_axes.md` horizontal note).** 57 Notification
  Cleanup Worker (nothing 60 days old), 58 UserStat Recalculation Worker (real-time counters carry MVP).
- **Image storage cloud backend.** `IImageStorageService` (minted WU12, MVP impl
  `LocalImageStorageService` writing under `wwwroot/uploads/`) gets a second implementation,
  `S3ImageStorageService` (`AWSSDK.S3`), swapped in behind the same frozen interface — MinIO endpoint
  via Aspire in dev, Cloudflare R2 endpoint in prod (same SDK code, different endpoint config — spec
  §3.17 / `cross-cutting.md`). Additive, no Layer 1–4 change. Pointer: `audit/ImageStorage.md`.
